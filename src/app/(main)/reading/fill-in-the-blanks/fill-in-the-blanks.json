Evan Ulrich and colleagues at the University of Maryland in College Park turned to the biological world for inspiration to build a scaled-down helicopter that could mimic the properties of full-size aircraft.\n\nThe complex  【design】 of full-size helicopters gets less efficient when shrunk,  【meaning】 that standard mini helicopters expend most of their power simply fighting to stay stable in the air. The researchers realised that a simpler aircraft designed to stay stable passively would use much less power and reduce manufacturing costs to boot.\n\nIt turns out that nature had  【beaten】 them to it. The seeds of trees such as the maple have a single-blade structure that  【allows】 them to fly far away and drift safely to the ground. These seeds, known as samaras, need no engine to  【spin】 through the air, thanks to a process called autorotation. By analysing the behaviour of the samara with high-speed cameras, Ulrich and his team were able to copy its design.\n\nThe samara copter is not the first single-winged helicopter – one was flown in 1952, and others have been attempted since – but it is the first to take advantage of the samara’s autorotation. This allows Ulrich’s vehicle to perform some neat tricks, such as falling safely to the ground if its motor fails or using vertical columns of air to stay aloft indefinitely. “We can turn off the motor and autorotate, which requires no power to sustain,” says Ulrich.",

His idea was to  【generate】 a unique identification tag for each species based on a short stretch of DNA. Separating species would then be a simple task of sequencing this tiny bit of DNA. Dr Hebert proposed part of a gene called cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as suitable to the task. All animals have it. It seems to vary enough, but not too much, to act as a reliable marker. And it is easily  【extracted】 , because it is one of a handful of genes found outside the cell nucleus, in structures called mitochondria.\n\nBarcoding has taken off rapidly since Dr Hebert invented it. When the idea was proposed, it was expected to be a  【boon】 to taxonomists trying to name the world's millions of species. It has, however, proved to have a far wider range of uses than the merely academic—most promisingly in the  【realm】 of public health.\n\nOne health-related project is the Mosquito Barcoding Initiative being run by Yvonne-Marie Linton of the Natural History Museum in London. This aims to barcode 80% of the world's mosquitoes within the next two years, to help control mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquitoes are  【responsible】 for half a billion malarial infections and 1m deaths every year. They also  【transmit】 devastating diseases such as yellow fever, West Nile fever and dengue. However, efforts to control them are consistently  【undermined】 by the difficulty and expense of identifying mosquitoes—of which there are at least 3,500 species, many of them hard to tell apart.",

Today, government encourages them to  【delay】 their retirement.\n\nWe now need to think of retirement as a phased process, where mature age workers  【gradually】  reduce their hours, and where they have considerable flexibility in how they combine their work and non-work time.\n\nWe also need to recognise the broader change that is occurring in how people work, learn, and live.

Under natural conditions, turtles hatch predominantly at night (although some early morning and late afternoon emergences occur) and show an innate and well-directed orientation to the water,  【relying】 mostly on light cues that attract them toward the brighter horizon above the sea surface. Artificial lighting on beaches is strongly attractive to hatchlings and can cause them to move away from the sea and  【interfere】 with their ability to orient in a constant direction. Ultimately, this disorientation due to light pollution can lead to death of hatchlings from exhaustion, dehydration and predation.",

The Lauder family's shares are worth more than $6 billion.\n\nBut early on, there wasn't a burgeoning business, there weren't houses in New York, Palm Beach, Fla., or the south of France. It is said that at one point there was one person to answer the telephones who  【changed】 her voice to become the shipping or billing department as needed. You more or less know the Estée Lauder story because it's a chapter from the book of American business folklore. In short, Josephine Esther Mentzer, daughter of immigrants, lived above her father's hardware store in Corona, a section of Queens in New York City. She started her  【enterprise】 by selling skin creams concocted by her uncle, a chemist, in beauty shops, beach clubs and resorts.\n\nNo doubt the potions were good — Estée Lauder was a quality fanatic — but the saleslady was better. Much better. And she simply outworked everyone else in the cosmetics industry. She  【stalked】 the bosses of New York City department stores until she got some counter space at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1948. And once in that space, she utilized a personal selling approach that proved as  【potent】 as the promise of her skin regimens and perfumes.",

In my point of view, this is the best thing that you can do. I know you have to fend for yourself, cook and clean after yourself, basically look after yourself without your parents but the truth is some time in your life you are going to have to part with lovely Mummy and Daddy. But they are only just a phone call away, and it is really good to have some quality time without them. The first few weeks can be a  【lonely】 period. There may be concerns about forming the friendship. When new students look around, it may seem that everyone else is self-confident and  【socially】 successful! The reality is that everyone has the same concerns. Increased personal freedom can feel both wonderful and  【frightening】 . Students can come and go as they choose with no one to hassle them. The strange environment with new kinds of procedures and new people can create the sense of being on an emotional roller coaster. This is normal and to be expected. You meet so many more people in the halls than if you stayed at home. The main points about living away from home are no parents! You don't have to tell them where you're going, who you're going with, what time you'll be coming, why you're going etc. You learn various social skills. You have to get along with your roommates. Living with them can present special, sometimes intense, problems. Negotiating respect of personal property, personal space, sleep, and relaxation needs, can be a complex task. The complexity increases when roommates are of different  【backgrounds】 with very different values. It is unrealistic to expect that roommates will be best friends. Meaningful, new relationships should not be expected to develop overnight. It took a great deal of time to develop intimacy in high school friendships; the same will be true of intimacy in university friendships. You have a phone! So if you ever get homesick or miss you, Mummy, then she's always at the end of a phone-line for you and so are your friends.",

The infants were then tested for their recognition of each made-up word.

According to Parncutt, who is based at the University of Graz in Austria, ‘motherese’ arose as a way to strengthen this maternal bond and to help  【ensure】 an infant’s survival.",

For most adults, seven to eight hours a night appears to be the best amount of sleep. However, for some people,“enough sleep”may be as few as five hours or as many as 10 hours of sleep.\n\nAs you get older, your sleeping  【patterns】 change. Older adults tend to sleep more lightly and awaken more frequently in the night than younger adults. This can have many causes including medical conditions and medications used to treat them. But there’s no evidence that older adults need less sleep than younger adults.\n\nGetting enough sleep is important to your health because it boosts your  【immune】 system, which makes your body better able to fight disease. Sleep is necessary for your nervous system to work properly. Too little sleep makes you drowsy and unable to concentrate.

People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short are not getting quality sleep.\n\nIf you experience frequent daytime sleepiness, even after increasing the amount of quality sleep you get, talk to your doctor.

For 【those】 who are struggling to balance their distance learning goals with working a full-time job and taking care of a family, this kind of flexibility can allow many people to pursue education who would not otherwise be able to do so.  【Since】 there are no on-campus courses to attend, students can learn from their own homes, at work on their lunch breaks and from virtually anywhere with internet access. For some, it can even be a big source of savings on their fuel costs and time required to commute to classes. ",

Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. The last search was conducted in December 2008. Eleven studies focused on the quantification of the energy cost associated with playing active video games, and eight studies focused on the utility of active video games as an  【intervention】 to increase physical activity in children. Compared with traditional nonactive video games, active video games  【elicited】 greater energy expenditure, which was similar in intensity to mild to moderate intensity physical activity. The intervention studies indicate that active video games may have the potential to increase free-living physical activity and improve body  【composition】 in children; however, methodological limitations prevent  【definitive】 conclusions. Future research should focus on larger, methodologically sound intervention trials to provide definitive answers as to whether this technology is effective in promoting long-term physical activity in children.",

In those days Northern Ireland was not yet  【plagued】 by bitter civil strife, and the Lewises were comfortably off. The family home, called Little Lea, was a large, gabled house with dark, narrow passages and an overgrown garden, which Warnie and Jack played in and  【explored】 together. There was also a library that was crammed with books - two of Jack's favorites were Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nThis somewhat idyllic boyhood came to an end for Lewis when his mother became ill and died of cancer in 1908. Barely a month after her death the two boys were sent away from home to go to boarding school in England. \n\nLewis hated the school, with its strict rules and hard,  【unsympathetic】 headmaster, and he missed Belfast terribly. Fortunately for him, the school closed in 1910, and he was able to return to Ireland.\n\nAfter a year, however, he was sent back to England to study. This time, the  【experience】 proved to be mostly positive. As a teenager, Lewis learned to love poetry, especially the works of Virgil and Homer. He also developed an interest in modern languages, mastering French, German, and Italian.",

A change in the way symphony orchestras  【recruit】 musicians provides an unusual way to test for sex-biased hiring. To overcome possible biases in hiring, most orchestras  【revised】 their audition policies in the 1970s and 1980s. A major change involved the use of blind' auditions with a screen' to conceal the identity of the candidate from the jury. Female musicians in the top five symphony orchestras in the United States were less than 5% of all players in 1970 but are 25% today. We ask whether women were more likely to be advanced and/or hired with the use of blind' auditions. Using data from actual auditions in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen  【increases】 by 50% the probability a woman will be advanced out of certain preliminary rounds. The screen also enhances, by severalfold, the likelihood a female contestant will be the winner in the final round. Using data on orchestra personnel, the switch to blind' auditions can explain between 30% and 55% of the increase in the proportion female among new hires and between 25% and 46% of the increase in the percentage female in the orchestras since 1970.",

The large vessels that followed each tried to outdo the previous one in terms of size and interior design. Using many of the most famous of interior  【designers】 , every part of the new ships was 'designed', from the cutlery to the China, from the furniture to the panelling, and from the bedrooms to the boat decks. Through Kronprinzessin Cecilie, Mauretania, Aquitania, Olympic, Titanic, Imperator, Vaterland, Ile de France, and Paris, the development and design of the ships grew grander and more luxurious. The process continued into the 1930s, with the Empress of Britain and the fabulously Art Deco Normandie, the finest and most expensive liner ever built, and designed to be a showcase for all that was France, as well as with the Queen Mary, a rather more traditional vessel, but one;  【nonetheless】 , which pushed the boundaries of design away from the traditional country house look of the Edwardian era. Each new vessel brought with it the finest of interiors, from the plush and palatial to the modern look of the time. Even today, the influence of these floating  【palaces】 can still be seen in vessels such as Cunard's Queen Mary 2 and the multitude of new cruise vessels, all vying for the public's interest and affection. The large liners were truly floating palaces, and here, William H. Miller brings together a collection of fabulous images of the finest ships ever built, showcasing the style and elegance of a time when 'getting there was half the fun'. ",

    "content": "Fans of biographical criticism have a luxurious source in the works of Hans Christian Andersen. Like Lewis Carroll (and, to a lesser extent, Kenneth Grahame), Andersen was near-pathologically uncomfortable in the company of adults. Of course all three had to work and  【interact】 with adults, but all three really related well to children and their simpler worlds. Andersen, for a time, ran a puppet theater and was incredibly popular with children, and, of course, he wrote an impressive body of fairy tales which have been produced in thousands of editions since the 19th century.\n\nMost everyone has read or at least knows the titles of many of Andersen's works: \"The Ugly Duckling,\" \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" \"The Nightengale,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" \"The Match Girl,\" and many others. Though, as with most folk and fairy tales, they  【strike】 adult re-readers much differently than they do young first-time readers.\n\nCharming tales of ducks who feel  【awkward】 because they don't fit in, only to exult in the discovery that they are majestic swans, gives child readers clearly-identifiable messages: don't tease people because they're different; don't fret about your being different because some day you'll discover what special  【gifts】 you have.\n\nA closer, deeper look at many of Andersen's tales (including \"The Ugly Duckling,\" which is not on our reading list), reveals a darker, harder, more  【painful】 thread. People are often cruel and unfeeling, love is torturous--in general, the things of the material world cause suffering. There is often a happy ending, but it's not conventionally happy. Characters are rewarded, but only after they manage (often through death) to transcend the rigors of the mortal world.",

This  【concept】 of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world. This understanding of culture equates culture with civilization and contrasts both with nature or non-civilization. According to this understanding of culture, some countries are more civilized than others, and some people are more cultured than others. Theorists like Matthew Arnold (1822-1888) believed that culture is simply that which is created by \"the best that has been thought and said in the world\". Anything that doesn't  【fit】 into this category is labeled as chaos or anarchy. From this perspective, culture is closely tied to cultivation, which is the progressive refinement of human  【behaviour】 .\n\nIn practice, culture referred to elite goods and activities such as haute cuisine, high fashion or haute couture, museum-caliber art and classical music. The word cultured referred to people who knew about and took part in these activities. For example, someone who used culture in this sense might  【argue】 that classical music is more refined than music by working-class people, such as jazz or the indigenous music traditions of aboriginal peoples.

The water carried mud to the surface, where it has spread across a region 2.5 miles (4 kilometres) in  【diameter】 in the eight months since the eruption began.\n\nThe mud volcano is similar to a gusher or blowout, which occur in oil drilling when oil or gas squirt to the surface, the team says. This upwelling, however, spews out a volume of mud equivalent to a dozen Olympic swimming pools each day. Although the eruption isn't as violent as a  【conventional】 volcano, more than a dozen people died when a natural gas pipeline ruptured. The research team, who published their findings in the February issue of GSA Today, also estimate that the volcano, called Lusi, will leave more than 11,000 people permanently displaced.\n",

For example, “kungu cakes” – made from midges – are a  【delicacy】 in parts of Africa. Mexico is an insect-eating – or entomophagous – hotspot, where more than 200 insect species are  【consumed】 . Demand is so high that 40 species are now under threat, including white agave worms. These caterpillars of the tequila giant-skipper butterfly fetch around $250 a kilogram.\n\nEating insects makes  【nutritional】 sense. Some contain more protein than meat or fish. The female gypsy moth, for instance, is about 80 per cent protein. Insects can be a good  【source】 of vitamins and minerals too: a type of caterpillar (Usta terpsichore) eaten in Angola is rich in iron, zinc and thiamine.\n\nWhat do they taste like? Ants have a lemon tang, apparently, whereas giant water bugs taste of mint and fire ant pupae of watermelon. You have probably, inadvertently, already tasted some of these things, as insects are often  【accidental】 tourists in other types of food.

Food-searching is an example of goal-directed behaviour, during which an animal must integrate information about both its external environment and internal state while using as little energy as possible. Lead researcher Professor George Kemenes, said: “This will eventually help us design the “brains” of robots based on the principle of using the fewest possible components necessary to perform complex tasks.“What goes on in our brains when we make complex behavioural decisions and carry them out is poorly understood.“Our study reveals for the first time how just two neurons can create a mechanism in an animal’s brain which drives and optimises complex decision-making tasks.

Nearly 52 percent of all selfies  【fell】 【into】 the appearance category: pictures of people showing off their make-up, clothes, lips, etc. Pics about looks were two times more popular than the other 14 categories combined.\n\n 【after】 appearances, social selfies with friends, loved ones, and pets were the most common (14 percent). Then came ethnicity pics (13 percent), travel (7 percent), and health and fitness (5 percent).\n\nThe researchers noted that the prevalence of ethnicity selfies (selfies about a person’s ethnicity, nationality or country of origin) is an indication that people are proud of their backgrounds. They also found that most selfies are solo pictures, rather than taken with a group.\n\nThe data was gathered in the summer of 2015. The research team believes the study is the first large-scale empirical research on selfies. Overall, an overwhelming 57 percent of selfies on Instagram were posted by the 18-35-year-old crowd, something the researchers say isn’t too surprising  【considering】 the demographics of the social media platform. The under-18 age group posted about 30 percent of selfies. The older crowd (35+) shared them far less frequently (13 percent). Appearance was most popular among all age groups.\n\nLead author Julia Deeb-Swihart says selfies are an identity performance—meaning that users carefully craft the way they appear online and that selfies are an extension of that. This evokes William Shakespeare’s famous line: “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.”",

Under his direction, Pratibha began making clothes with organic cotton in 1999. Initially, the company couldn't find enough organic farms growing cotton in central India to  【supply】 its factories.\n\nTo meet production demands, Chaudhary's team had to convince conventional cotton farmers to change their growing methods. Pratibha provided seeds, cultivation instruction, and a guarantee of fair-trade prices for  【their】 crops. Today, Pratibha has a network of 28,000 organic cotton growers across the central states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Orissa.",

She studies plants at the University of Cambridge in England.\n\nIn 2009, Glover and her colleagues showed that even when petals look  【shimmery】 , bees can still tell which flowers likely hold food. But she and others noticed something odd about iridescence. It’s not quite as flashy in plants as in other life forms, Glover says. The backs of jewel beetles or the wings of certain butterflies, for instance, shine and shimmer a lot more.\n\nThe researchers tested their hypothesis in the lab. They trained a group of bees to associate fake purple flowers with getting more nectar. Then the team tested the bees. They added non-shimmery  【fake】 flowers with purple-blue and purple-red hues to the bees’ flight path. The bees passed the test, ignoring flowers that weren’t perfectly purple.\n\nA second group of bees was trained to drink from fully flashy, “perfectly iridescent” purple flowers. But when the team added perfectly iridescent flowers in different hues, the insects checked them for nectar too.\n\nA third group of bees, however, had no problem finding the right flowers when the petals had only a little bit of bling. These bees were trained to drink from “ 【imperfectly】 iridescent” purple flowers. When the team added imperfectly iridescent flowers in different hues, the bees weren’t confused at all. “They could still clearly identify the purple flowers as the good ones,” Glover says. That means imperfect iridescence is best for bees. ",

For example, at the magnetic north pole, one of two poles where the magnetic field is the strongest, the direction of the field points vertically downwards, into the ground. In the wider northern hemisphere, this vertical angle  【changes】 but the magnetic field is always skewed downwards.",

    "content": "For many first-year students, the University may be their first experience living away from home for an  【extended】 period of time. It is a  【definite】 break from home. In my point of view this is the best thing that you can do. I know you have to fend for yourself, cook and clean after yourself, basically look after yourself without your parents but the truth is – some time in your life you are going to have to part with lovely Mummy and Daddy. But they are only just a phone call away and it is really good to have some quality time without them. The first few weeks can be a  【lonely】 period. There may be concerns about forming friendship. When new students look around, it may seem that everyone else is self-confident and  【socially】 successful! The reality is that everyone is having the same concerns.  \n\nIncreased personal freedom can feel both wonderful and  【frightening】 . Students can come and go as they choose with no one to “hassle” them. The strange environment with new kinds of procedures and new people can create the sense of being on an emotional roller coaster. This is normal and to be expected. You meet so many more people in the halls than if you stayed at home. The main points about living away from home are: NO PARENTS! You don’t have to tell them where you’re going, who you’re going with, what time you’ll be coming, why you’re going etc. etc.  \n\nYou learn various social skills; you have to get along with your roommates Living with them can present special, sometimes intense, problems. Negotiating respect of personal property, personal space, sleep, and relaxation needs, can be a complex task. The complexity increases when roommates are of different  【backgrounds】 with very different values. It is unrealistic to expect that roommates will be best friends. Meaningful, new relationships should not be expected to develop overnight. It took a great deal of time to develop intimacy in high school friendships; the same will be true of intimacy in university friendships. You have a phone! So if you ever get homesick or miss you Mummy then she’s always at the end of a phone-line for you – and so are your friends.",

    "content": "The invasion of non-indigenous plants is considered a primary threat to integrity and function of ecosystems. However, there is little quantitative or  【experimental】 evidence for ecosystem impacts of invasive species. Justifications for control are often based on potential, but not presently realized, recognized or quantified, negative impacts. Should lack of scientific certainty about impacts of non-indigenous species result in postponing measures to prevent degradation? Recently, management of purple loosestrife, has been criticized for lack of evidence demonstrating negative impacts of L. salicaria, and management using biocontrol for lack of evidence documenting the failure of conventional control methods. Although little quantitative evidence on negative impacts on native wetland biota and wetland function was available at the onset of the control program in 1985, recent work has demonstrated that the invasion of purple loosestrife into North American freshwater wetlands alters  【decomposition】 rates and nutrient cycling, leads to reductions in wetland plant diversity, reduces pollination and seed output of the native Lythrum alatum, and reduces habitat  【suitability】 for specialized wetland bird species such as black terns, least bitterns, pied-billed grebes, and marsh wrens. Conventional methods (physical, mechanical or chemical), have continuously failed to  【curb】 the spread of purple loosestrife or to provide satisfactory control. Although a number of generalist insect and bird species utilize purple loosestrife, wetland habitat specialists are excluded by  【encroachment】 of L. salicaria. We conclude that negative ecosystem impacts of purple loosestrife in North America justify control of the species and that  【detrimental】 effects of purple loosestrife on wetland systems and biota and the potential benefits of control outweigh potential risks associated with the introduction of biocontrol agents. Long-term experiments and monitoring programs that are in place will evaluate the impact of these insects on purple loosestrife, on wetland plant succession and other wetland biota.",

The promised treats were always visible and the child knew that all she had to do to stop the agonizing wait was ring a bell to call the experimenter back – although in that  【case】 , she wouldn't get the second treat. The longer a child delayed gratification, Mischel found – that is, the longer she was able to wait – the better she would fare later in life at numerous measures of what we now call executive function. She would  【perform】 better academically, earn more money, and be healthier and happier.

    "content": "The precise relationship between fiction and life has been debated extensively. Most modern critics agree that, whatever its apparent factual content or verisimilitude, fiction is finally to be regarded as a structured imitation of life and should not be confused with a literal  【transcription】 of life itself. While fiction is a work of the imagination rather than  【reality】 . It can also be based closely on real events, sometimes experienced by the author. In a work of fiction, the author is not the same as the narrator, the voice that tells the story. Authors maintain a distance from their characters. Sometimes that distance is obvious for instance, if a male writer tells a story from the point of view of a female character. Other times it is not so obvious, especially if we know something of the author’s life and there are clear connections between the story and the author’s life. The writer of fiction is free to choose his or her subject matter and is free to invent, select, and  【arrange】 functional elements to  【achieve】  his or her purpose. The elements of fiction are the different components that make up a work of fiction. All literature explores a theme or significant truth expressed in various elements such as character, plot, setting, point of view, style, and tone that are essential and specific to each work of fiction. All of these elements bin a literary work into a consistent whole and give it unity. Understanding these elements can help the reader gain insight about life, human motives, and experience. Such insight is one of the principal  【aims】 of an effective work of fiction; when readers are  【able】 to perceive it, they develop a sense a literary judgement that is capable of enriching their lives. The following sections describe elements that should be considered in the  【analysis】 of fiction.",

    "content": "Many Utopias have been dreamed up through the ages. From Plato's Republic to Thomas More's Utopia and beyond, serious thinkers have  【envisioned】 societies where people live in peace and harmony. Most of these imaginary worlds have things in common: everybody is equal and plays a part in the running of the society; nobody goes without the essentials of life; people live mostly off the land; often there is no money, and so on. Another thing they have in  【common】 is that, to the average person, they appear distasteful or unworkable since they do not take into account ordinary human nature or feelings. Architects have got in on the act, too. After the Great Fire of London, Christopher Wren drew up plans for a reconstruction of the whole city, including  【precise】 street widths. And in the 20th century there was Le Corbusier's Radiant City in which, if you weren't in a car or didn't have one, life would have been a nightmare. Also in the 20th century; another famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright,  【dreamed】 up a perfect city that got no further than the drawing-board. Wright believed that what was wrong with modern cities was, in his words, rent. Ideas, land, even money itself, had to be paid for. He saw this as a form of slavery and believed that modern city dwellers had no sense of themselves as productive individuals. Thus, Wright's city was to be made up of numerous individual homesteads, and the houses themselves were to be simple, functional and in  【harmony】 with the environment. Everyone would own enough land to grow food for himself and his family. No outsiders would be allowed to come between the citizen and what he produced, or to exploit both for money. Goods and services would all be  【exchanged】 , not bought and sold for profit. ",

    "content": "Crime prevention has a long history in Australia, and in other parts of the world. In all societies, people have tried to  【protect】 themselves and those close to them from assaults and other abuses. Every time someone locks the door to their house or their car, they practise  【a form of】 prevention. Most parents want their children to learn to be law abiding and not spend extended periods of their lives in prison. In this country, at least, most succeed. Only a small minority of young people become  【recidivist】 offenders. In a functioning society, crime prevention is part of everyday life.\n\nWhy, then, have three Australian criminologists written a book about crime prevention and community safety? There are several reasons. The first is that while prevention can be all-pervasive at the grassroots, it is oddly neglected in mass media and political discourses. When politicians, talkback radio hosts and newspaper editorialists pontificate about crime and  【possible】 remedies, it is comparatively  【rare】 for them to mention prevention. Overwhelmingly, emphasis is on policing, sentencing and other ‘law and order’ responses.",

Within a week, the patient has a dry cough, which might  【progress】 to shortness of breath. In 10% to 20% of cases, patients require mechanical ventilation to breathe. About 3.5% die from the disease. Symptoms  【generally】 begin in two to seven days, but some reports suggest it might take as long as 10 days. Scientists are close to  【developing】 a lab test to diagnose SARS. In the meantime, it is diagnosed by its symptoms. There is no evidence that antibiotics or anti-viral medicines help, so doctors can offer only supportive care. Patients with SARS are kept in isolation to reduce the risk of transmission. Scientists aren't sure yet, but some researchers think it's a newly discovered coronavirus, the family of viruses that cause some common colds.\n\nMost cases appear to have been passed through droplets expelled when infected patients cough or sneeze. Family members of infected people and medical workers who care for them have been most likely to contract the illness. But recent developments in Hong Kong suggest that the disease might spread through air, or that the virus might linger for two to three hours on doorknobs or other  【surfaces】 . Health experts say it is unlikely, though, that sharing an elevator briefly with an infected person would be enough to pass the virus. ",

Speaking at the 2012 New Zealand Finance Colloquium, held at Massey University’s Albany campus last week, Dr Matthews said demographic characteristics had a substantial impact on the choices people made about KiwiSaver funds and retirement savings more generally. When it came to fund selection, she found there were significant differences based on gender. Men are more likely to invest in aggressive and  【growth】 funds, while women are more likely to choose  【conservative】 funds.\n\n“Males are risk takers,  【whether】 it’s in their choice of car or their investment fund,” she says. “But when it comes to long-term savings, risk taking can actually be an advantage.” Dr Matthews also found that men are more likely than women to have prior savings when joining KiwiSaver. Just over half of male respondents said they had savings already, while only 38% of women did. “These figures reflect and confirm, quite disappointingly, the difference between males and females and the level of interest they take in financial planning,” Dr Matthews says. “It’s important for all New Zealanders to be better educated about their personal finances, but this is particularly so for women.”\n\nOther demographic factors, including age, ethnicity, education, and income, can also influence the choices  【being】 made about retirement savings. Dr Matthews found that those with bachelor and higher degrees, and those in households with a pre-tax income of $100,000 or more, were more likely to choose aggressive and growth funds.\n\nOn the other hand, both the youngest and oldest age groups were more likely to be invested in conservative funds. While this might be appropriate for the life-cycle stage of older investors, it might not be so appropriate for younger, longer-term investors.",
