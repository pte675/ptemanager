    "content": "In contrast to some other motivational theories, reinforcement theory ignores the inner state of the individual. Instead it focuses on what happens to an individual when he or she  【reforms,conforms,confirms,performs_】 some task or action. Reinforcement theorists see behavior as being environmentally controlled. Rather than internal thoughts or desires, the theory is that behaviors are controlled by reinforcers—any consequence that, when immediately following a response, increases the  【tendency,potency,probability_,capability】 that the behavior will be repeated. For example, you decided to work over the weekend to finish a project early for your boss. When your boss finds out about your extra effort, she thanks you and buys you lunch. Assuming your boss’s reactions were  【comparable,favorable_,reliable,incomparable】 to you, you will be more likely to do similar deeds in the future. If your boss said or did nothing to acknowledge your extra work, you would be less likely to  【demonstrate_,reflect,change,impact】 similar behavior in the future."

Indigenous peoples, in particular. Except for salt, all food comes from the biosphere, but established societies  【confer,refer,concur,prefer_】 to farm rather than forage. The biosphere is a relatively thin layer of the Earth’s surface that supports life, reaching from a few kilometers into the atmosphere to deep-sea vents. The biosphere is a global ecosystem made up of living organisms (biota) and the nonliving (abiotic) factors that provide them with energy and nutrients. The biosphere is a narrow zone on the surface of the earth where soil, water, and air combine to  【obtain,sustain_,restrain,pertain】 life. Life can only occur in this zone. From fungi and bacteria to large animals, there are several different types of life.\n\nThe biosphere is  【characterised_,overemphasized,sensationalized,revolutionized】 as an environment that contains all living organisms and the products of their activities. As a result, it plays a vital role in the  【predominance,maintenance,conservation_,appurtenance】 of ecosystems, i.e., the life of species and their reciprocal interactions.

    "content": "Dr. Philip Lieberman of Brown University explained on NPR's \"The Human Edge\" that after humans  【diverged_,converged,urged,merged】 from an early-ape ancestor more than 100,000 years ago, the shape of the mouth and vocal tract changed, with the tongue and larynx, or voice box, moving further down the tract. The tongue became more  【ineligible,convertible,irresistible,flexible_】 and independent and was able to be controlled more precisely. The tongue is attached to the hyoid bone, which is not attached to any other bones in the body. Meanwhile, the human neck grew longer to accommodate the tongue and larynx, and the human mouth grew smaller. The larynx is lower in the throats of humans than it is in chimpanzees, which, along with the increased flexibility of the mouth, tongue, and lips, is what enables humans to speak as well as to change  【ditch,state,pitch_,impacts】 and sing. The ability to speak and develop language was an enormous advantage for humans. The disadvantage of this  【imaginary,preliminary,visionary,evolutionary_】 development is that this flexibility comes with an increased risk of food going down the wrong tract and causing choking."

The principle that value depends on supply and demand means that in the case of nearly every commodity, more will be bought if the price is lowered, less will be bought if the price is  【higher,raised_,folded,kept】 . Therefore sellers, if they wish to induce buyers to take more of a commodity than they are already doing, must reduce its price; if they raise its price, they will sell less. If there is a general falling off if in demand-- due, say, to trade depression -- sellers will either have to  【trade,treat,describe,reduce_】 prices or put less on the market; they will not be able to sell the same  【quantity,patch,amount_deal】 at the same price. Similarly with supply. At a certain price a certain amount will be offered for sale, at a higher price more will be offered, at a lower price less. If consumers want more, they must offer a higher price; if they want less, they will probably be able to force prices down. That is the first result of a change in demand or supply. "

    "content": "Bones also protect the organs in our bodies. The skull protects the brain and forms the shape of the face. The spinal cord, a pathway for messages between the brain and the body, is protected by the backbone, or spinal column. The ribs form a cage that  【shelters_,alleviates,moves,incurs】 the heart and lungs, and the pelvis helps protect the bladder, part of the intestines, and in women, the reproductive organs. Bones are made up of a framework of a protein called collagen, with a mineral called calcium phosphate that makes the framework hard and strong. Bones store calcium and release some into the bloodstream when it's needed by other parts of the body. The amounts of certain vitamins and minerals that you eat, especially vitamin D and calcium, directly affect how much calcium is stored in the bones. Joints are where  【two_,which,that,the】 bones meet. They make the skeleton flexible — without them, movement would be impossible. Joints allow our bodies to move in many ways. Some joints open and close like a hinge (such as knees and elbows), whereas others allow for more complicated movement — a shoulder or hip joint, for example, allows for backward, forward, sideways, and rotating movement. Joints are classified by their range of movement: Immovable, or fibrous, joints don't move. The dome of the skull, for example, is made of bony plates, which move slightly during birth and then fuse together as the skull finishes growing. Between the edges of these plates are links, or joints, of fibrous tissue. Fibrous joints also hold the teeth in the jawbone. Partially movable, or cartilaginous, joints move a little. They are linked by cartilage, as in the spine. Each of the vertebrae in the spine moves in relation to the one above and below it, and together these movements give the spine its flexibility. Freely movable, or synovial, joints move in many directions. The main joints of the body — such as those found at the hip, shoulders, elbows, knees, wrists, and ankles — are freely movable. They are filled with synovial fluid, which acts as a lubricant to help the joints move easily.  【three_,none,single,all】 kinds of freely movable joints play a big part in voluntary movement: Hinge joints allow movement in one direction, as seen in the knees and elbows. Pivot joints allow a rotating or twisting motion, like that of the head moving from side to side. Ball-and-socket joints allow the greatest freedom of movement. The hips and shoulders have this type of joint, in which the round end of a long bone fits into the hollow of another bone."

However, some people find cilantro  【vaccinating,revolting_,suspecting,invigorating】 . Of course some of this dislike may come down to simple preference, but for those cilantro-haters for whom the plant tastes like soap, the issue is genetic. These people have a variation in a group of olfactory-receptor genes that allows them to strongly perceive the soapy-flavored aldehydes in cilantro leaves. This genetic  【taint,density,dam,quirk_】 is usually only found in a small percent of the population, though it varies geographically. Interestingly, places where cilantro is especially popular, such as Central America and India, have fewer people with these genes, which might explain how the herb was able to become such a  【homestay,mainstay_,factor,competitor】 in those regions. East Asians have the highest incidence of this variation, with some studies showing that nearly 20% of the population experiences soapy-tasting cilantro. There is some evidence that cilantrophobes can overcome their aversion with repeated exposure to the herb, especially if it is crushed rather than served whole."

The Ancient Greeks recognized the importance of all these activities being  【observed,performed_,achieved,complied】 alongside mathematics and physics, because they complemented each other.\n\nIndeed, a new scientific study now comes to prove just that. Researchers at the Ohio State University in the US have reviewed the behavior of children, mostly in high-schools, who have been  【given,showed,presented,exposed_】 to music lessons either early in life, or throughout their school years.

    "content": "You open your lunch box to discover that the lovely apple you sliced this morning now appears unsightly and brown. Why does this happen? This  【unappetizing_,galvanizing,anthologizing,characterizing】 phenomenon is actually due to a chain of biochemical reactions known as “enzymatic browning.” When an apple is injured (or cut into pieces), the plant tissue is exposed to oxygen. This  【triggers_,simplifies,fosters,constricts】 an enzyme known as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to—wait for it—oxidize polyphenols in the apple’s flesh. This results in new chemicals (o-quinones), which then react with amino acids to produce brown-colored melanins. Different apple varieties contain different amounts of both the initial enzyme and the polyphenols, and thus they brown at different rates.\n\nEnzymatic browning is not  【contended,related,profiled,unique_】 to apples. Pears, bananas, and eggplants also turn brown fairly quickly when cut. Enzymatic browning is also responsible for the desirable dark color of prunes, coffee, black tea, and cocoa. Scientists are working to genetically  【designate,envelope,dilute,engineer_】 apples that do not produce the PPO enzyme, so perhaps brown apples will someday be a thing of the past."

    "content": "The momentum to adopt more sustainable business practices is building. And investors are increasingly considering the consequences of where they direct capital — and the impact it has on our planet and society. Investors may choose to invest in either public or  【financial,material,written,private_】 markets, but while these both provide opportunities to invest responsibly, the extent and nature of the impact differs. According to a recent Deloitte Report, $55 trillion is projected to be invested in ESG-mandated assets in 2022. And at their current growth rate ESG-mandated assets are expected to  【set,make_add,put】 up half of all professionally managed assets globally by 2024. In public markets, investors have the opportunity to support global environmental and social transformation through their active  【service,investment,ingredient,engagement_】 with management and how they vote on company resolutions. This can be more influential than the capital allocation itself. By contrast, in private markets the capital allocation decision is key, and it is possible to  【prove,collapse,drive_,restore】 positive change at speed by allocating resources directly to highly specific areas."

Similarly, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought.

These trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur. "

The confusion is partly political - the Spanish-speaking world is very diverse. Spanish is the language of 19 separate countries and Puerto Rico. This means that there is no one standard dialect.

These include the pronunciation of \"ci\" and \"ce\" as \"th.\" In Madrid, \"gracias\" (thank you) becomes \"gratheas\" (as opposed to \"gras-see-as\" in Latin America). Another difference is the use of the word \"vosotros\" (you all, or you guys) as the informal form of \"ustedes\" in Spain.

Ballet, ballroom or breakdancing, it doesn’t matter: getting into the groove does  【wonders_,businesses,researches,work】 for you. And it’s not just the joy of moving to music. Dancing is good for the brain too. It can change the way you think and even keep your mind  【sharp_,closed,clean,blank】 as you age.\n\n“People are born to move. They are born to move rhythmically,” says dance psychologist Peter Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. Admittedly, we are not all blessed with the same degree of  【uncertainty,talent_,risk,information】 for it, but dancing is ingrained in human nature.

An experiment involving 21 infants aged less than 7 months found they were more likely to stop crying and fall asleep when their mother walked with them, compared with when they were held by their mother in a chair or  【lay,laid_,lied,laying】 in a cot. “This finding makes sense because when most people pick up a crying baby, they rarely just stand still with them, they  【constructively,collectively,interrogatively,instinctively_】 walk around,” says Harriet Hiscock at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Scientists became interested in how babies respond to motion after studying the “transport response” in other mammals, in which infants become passive and develop slower heart rates when their mothers carry them. To test the effect in people, the team monitored 21 crying babies in Japan and Italy while their mothers tried four methods to  【calm_,pause,wind,scare】 them: holding their baby while walking, moving them back and forth in a pram or rocking cot, holding them while seated and laying them down in a cot."

He found, to put it most  【succinctly_,sceptically,sincerely,successfully】 that children don't think like grownups. After thousands of interactions with young people often barely old enough to talk, Piaget began to  【understand,suspect_,suspend,know】 that behind their cute and seemingly illogical utterances were thought processes that had their own kind of order and their own special logic. Einstein called it a  【mystery,success,discovery_,misery】 \"so simple that only a genius could have thought of it.\"\n\nPiaget's insight opened a new window into the inner workings of the mind. By the end of a wide- ranging and remarkably  【prolific_,varied,resulted,reputable】 research career that spanned nearly 75 years, from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84, Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and what came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he  【designed,championed_,guided,opened】 a way of thinking about children that provided the foundation for today's education-reform  【revolution,reforms,regulations,movements_】 . It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of \"noble savages\" and \"cannibals\" by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take children's thinking seriously."

The history of the British empire in India was no different. It is important to note in this connection that the concept of international boundaries (between two sovereign states), demarcated and delineated, was yet to emerge in India under Mughal rule."

As such, these undesirable byproducts of egg production may be killed through gassing, but oftentimes they are culled through maceration, which involves literally grinding up the male chicks alive. In the U.S., maceration is the standard practice. But a groundbreaking development could have major implications for animal welfare in the poultry industry, perhaps finally putting an end to the  【sliding,pulling,culling_,curling】 of an estimated seven billion male chicks each year shortly after they hatch due to their lack of commercial value.

After the scans, the volunteers were asked to  【bid_,receive,provide,quote】  money in a competitive auction for the food they wanted to have for a snack. Compared to food containing just carbs or fat, the team found that foods high in both of these together  【provoked_,revoked,invoked,evoked】 far more activity in the brain’s striatum – a region involved in reward that releases the feel-good chemical dopamine. The volunteers were also willing to pay more for the snacks that were high in both carbs and fat, despite all the food items having the same calorific value."

We should emphasise the old-fashioned virtues of uniting in the face of a crisis, of resourcefulness and community action. Projects like the transition towns network and proposals for a green new deal tell a story which people are more willing to hear."

In 1267, the English monk Roger Bacon  【according,recorded_,recalled,depended】 seeing what were very likely firecrackers, which he compared with the flash of lightning and growl of thunder.\n\nIn 1377 fireworks accompanied a religious mystery play by the bishop’s palace in Vicenza, and were soon used to add sparks to figures of doves, representing the Holy Spirit, or angels, made to ascend and descend from the heavens on ropes.\n\nBy the 15th century, rockets were being used in Europe for military and peaceful purposes. Italian and Spanish cities in particular  【began_,start,beginning,begin】 to use fireworks for outdoor celebrations. The Italian metallurgist Vannoccio Biringuccio described festivities in Florence and Siena for feast days. These included “girandoles” or whirling decorated wheels packed with fireworks which were  【suspending,expedited,suspended_,prolonged】 from a rope hung across a street or square.\n\nFireworks were also used in the German lands. An elaborate colour-painted book 【memorizes,commemorates_,cultivates,observes】 the Schembart carnival of Nuremberg, which saw men dressed in brightly-coloured costumes parading through the town. Often these included some kind of pyrotechnics.

    "content": "In this role, due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs.\n\nDue to their demanding personalities and need for mental  【establishment,estimation,stimulation_,condition】 and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviors in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs,  【abrupt,destructive_,corruptive,preventive】 scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed’s herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being  【exceeding,eminently_,impossibly,minorly】 trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialization training.\n\nBefore taking on the breed as a household pet, potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise  【collaborative,communicate,commensurate_,cooperate】 with the collie’s high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock, and these dogs will be  【tossed,pinched,distressed_,flexible】 and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. Like many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behavior can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviors require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.\n"

The clash between these two sentiments is evident in every established city  【until,if,after,unless_】 its development has been almost completely accidental or is lost in history. Incidentally, many settlements have been planned from the beginning but, for a variety of reasons, no settlement followed the plan. A good example is Currowan, on the Clyde River in New South Wales, which  【has,were,being,was_】  【ignored,confessed,surveyed_,generated】 in the second half of the 19th century, in expectation that people would come to establish agriculture and a small port.

While the proportion of total  【finance,profit,funds,revenue_】 raised through HECS is relatively small, HECS payments are a significant component of students' university costs, with many students carrying a HECS debt for several years after leaving university. This article also focuses on characteristics of university students based on their HECS liability status, and the level of accumulated HECS debt."

    "content": "Called Chomolungma (\"goddess mother of the world\") in Tibet and Sagarmatha (\"goddess of the sky\") in Nepal, Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name of Peak XV among Westerners. That was before  【experts,examiners,surveyors_,climbers】 established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that came as something of a surprise - Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the  【anticipation,illusion_,prediction,allusion】 of greater height.\n\nIn 1852 the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially  【accepted_,understood,calculated,known】 height for more than one hundred years. In 1955 it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028 (8,848 m).\n\nThe mountain received its official name in 1865 in honor of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830-1843 who had mapped the Indian subcontinent. He had some  【rejections,conservation,reservations_,thinking】 about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies.\n\nBefore the Survey of India, a number of other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet (6,310 m), it is in fact nowhere near the highest,  【surpassed_,reduced,transformed,transmitted】 by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozen in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri (26,810 ft.; 8,172 m) was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga (28,208 ft.; 8,598 m), which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivaled for the last century and a half, but not without a few threats."

    "content": "Movement in painting that  【started,originated_,initiated,prevailing】 in France in the 1860s and had enormous influence in European and North American painting in the late 19th century. The Impressionists wanted to  【express,show,depict_,know】 real life, to paint straight from nature, and to capture the changing effects of light. The term was first used abusively to describe Claude Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise (1872). The other leading Impressionists included Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Edouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, but only Monet remained devoted to Impressionist ideas throughout his career.\n\nThe core of the Impressionist group was formed in the early 1860s by Monet, Renoir, and Sisley, who met as students and enjoyed painting in the open air – one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. They met other members of the Impressionist circle through Paris café society. They never made up a formal group, but they organized eight group exhibitions between 1874 and 1886, at the first of which the name Impressionism was applied. Their styles were diverse, but all  【revealed,experimented_,concluded,tested】 with effects of light and movement created with distinct brushstrokes and  【fragments_,dots,areas,parts】 of colour dabbed side-by-side on the canvas rather than mixed on the palette. By the 1880s the movement's central impulse had dispersed, and a number of new styles were emerging, later described as post-Impressionism.\n\nBritish Impressionism had a major influence on the more  【quantitative,experimental_,influential,complex】 and progressive British painters in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many of the painters affected were in the circle of Walter Sickert, who spent much of his career in France and was an influential figure who  【inspired_,acquired,aspired,admired】 many younger artists. His friend and exact contemporary Philip Wilson Steer are generally regarded as the most outstanding British Impressionist."

This edition is projected to run to  【some_,mostly,just,more】 eighty volumes. Members of the public are invited to assist in this massive editorial task by helping to transcribe Bentham's manuscripts via Transcribe Bentham."

Parenting classes, marital relationships, public schools, counseling, and tutoring are just some of the areas where active listening is a valued skill. As the name  【complies,implies_,defies,replies】 , the focus of active listening as a tool for improving communication is on listening rather than talking. It is a process where the listener sets aside his own thoughts to concentrate more clearly what the speaker is actually saying instead of what the listener thinks the speaker is saying. It takes practice to  【explain,master_,witness,reverse】 the basic techniques of active listening, and you will probably feel awkward applying the technique in the beginning. But because the point is to increase  【addressability,restiveness,activeness,effectiveness_】 by decreasing the possibility of misunderstandings, it is worth a little discomfort."

    "content": "In 2005, 109,000 new marriages were registered in Australia. This was equivalent to 5.4 marriages for every 1,000 people in the population. This rate has been in overall decline since 1986 when there were 7.2 marriages per 1,000 people. \n\nOver the same period, the crude divorce rate has remained relatively unchanged with 2.6 divorces for every 1,000 people in 2005 and 2.5 divorces per 1,000 people in 1986. The greatest annual number of divorces occurred in 2001 when there were 55,300 divorces recorded. This peak has been followed by recent declines, with 52,400 divorces in 2005.\n\nAs well as marrying less, Australians are  【contribute,tending_,lead,meaning】 to marry later than in the past. In 1986, the median age at first marriage for men was 25.6 years, increasing to 30.0 years in 2005. For women, the median age at first marriage increased from 23.5 years in 1986 to 28.0 years in 2005. \n\nPeople are also divorcing at older ages. In 2005, the median age of divorcing men was 43.5 years, compared with 37.5 years in 1986, while for women the median age in 2005 was 40.8 compared with 34.7 years in 1986.\n \nThe  【increase,decline_,jump,reducing】 in marriage rates and increase in divorce rates has led to a  【decrease_,down,area,state】 in the proportion of the population that is formally married. In 1986, 60% of the population aged 15 years and over were married; by 2001 this proportion had decreased to 55%.  【Normally,Especially,Conversely_,Actually】 , the  【example,proposal,proportion_,property】 of the population aged 15 years and over who were never married increased from 29% in 1986 to 32% in 2001.

As long as an author uses one-dimensional characters correctly, and with deliberate intention, there is nothing wrong with it. Often, a narrative is most successful with a  【rejuvenation,combination_,determination,inclination】 of flat and rounded characters. With that said, it's important to have strong character development overall to create rounded characters that have some depth to them. This helps characters  【intimidate,intimate,imitate_,immediate】 being a real human being. Being able to relate to characters in this way, as a reader, makes them far more interesting and realistic."

It is easy to forget the importance of the biosciences when working with model organisms in basic research that seem to have nothing to do with a sick child or a suffering elderly person. Yet, I still have vivid memories of the cruel kaleidoscope of severe diseases and of how they can strike a human being, I hope to retain these memories as a guide to my current occupation."

An individual organism can regulate its internal processes rapidly to sustain itself within the usual range of environmental changes that it  【encounters_,reimburses,run,surrender】 hourly or daily.

Homeostatic regulation usually cannot meet effectively large environmental changes such as those that would allow a plant or animal living in the warmth of summer to  【conjunction,cite,construct,function_】 in the cold of winter. As summer wanes, organisms change their substance and their habits in seeming anticipation of the coming winter. This gradual adjustment to conditions is acclimatization. "

So-called “handedness” runs in families, but what causes it and why the proportion of left-handed to right-handed people is a constant are still a mystery.

Brain[function] is  【figured,changed,distributed_,added】 into the left and right hemispheres, and this is crucial for understanding language, thought, memory, and perhaps even creativity. For right-handed people, language activity is mainly on the left side. Many left-handers also have left-side language dominance, but a significant number may have language either more  【largely,mainly,evenly_barely】 distributed in both hemispheres or else predominantly on the right side of the brain.

His research contains three parts that include preliminary exploration of design innovation qualities, investigation of resulting classroom practices, and development of evidence-based assessment. The assessment he describes is presented in the form of a structured worksheet, which includes a collaborative  【factor,element_,collection,work】 and digital photographs, in story format. Such a device encourages stimulating ideas, but does not recognize students as design  【officers,workers,innovators_,leaders】 . The assessment sheet includes holistic impressions as well as details about “having, growing, and proving” ideas. \n\n 【Colloquial_,Traditional,Written,Formal】 judgments are evident in terms such as “wow” and “yawn” and reward the quality and quantity of ideas with the term, “sparkiness”, which fittingly is a pun as the model project was to design light bulb packaging. In addition, the assessment focuses on the process of optimizing or complexity control as well as proving ideas with thoughtful criticism and not just generation of novel ideas. The definitions for qualities such as “technical” and “aesthetic” pertaining to users, are too narrow and ill-defined. The author provides examples of the project, its features and structures, students’ notes and judgments, and their  【documents,sketches_,scaffold,information】 and photographs of finished light bulb packages, in the Appendix."

Radio, telegraph, television, and other inventions brought competition for newspapers. So did the development of magazines and other means of communication. However, this competition merely spurred the newspapers on. They quickly made use of the newer and faster means of communication to improve the  【speed_, quantity, economy, distance】 and thus the efficiency of their own operations. Today more newspapers are printed and read than ever before. Competition also led newspapers to branch out to many other fields. Besides keeping readers  【upcoming, informed_, informing, acknowledgeable】 of the latest news, today’s newspapers educate and influence readers about politics and other important and serious matters. Newspapers influence readers’ economic choices through advertising. Most newspapers depend on advertising for their very existence. Newspapers are sold at a price that fails to cover even a small fraction of the cost of production. The main source of income for most newspapers is commercial advertising. The success in selling advertising depends on a newspaper’s value to advertisers. This is  【levelled, measured_, mixed, formed】 in terms of circulation. How many people read the newspaper? Circulation depends much on the work of the circulation department and on the services or entertainment offered in a newspaper’s pages. But for the most part, circulation depends on a newspaper’s value to readers as a source of information about the community, city, country, state, nation, and world—and even outer space."

The hypothesis is that name stereotypes can be manifested in facial appearance, producing a face-name matching effect,  【notwithstanding,ever,whereby_,despite】 both a social perceiver and a computer are able to accurately match a person's name to his or her face. In 8 studies we demonstrate the  【indolence,evanescence,existence_,transience】 of this effect, as participants examining an unfamiliar face accurately select the person's true name from a list of several names, significantly above chance level. We replicate the effect in 2 countries and find that it extends  【into,beyond_,within,by】 the limits of socioeconomic cues. We also find the effect using a computer-based paradigm and 94,000 faces. In our exploration of the underlying mechanism, we show that existing name stereotypes produce the effect, as its occurrence is culture-dependent. A self-fulfilling  【prophecy_,observation,preference,stipulation】 seems to be at work, as initial evidence shows that facial appearance regions that are controlled by the individual (e.g., hairstyle) are sufficient to produce the effect, and socially using one's given name is necessary to generate the effect. Together, these studies suggest that facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look. In this way a social tag may influence one's facial appearance.

This  【classification,concept_,renovation,identify】 of culture reflected inequalities within European societies and their colonies around the world.

Then, they asked a group of 29 international experts on Antarctic biodiversity to assess the cost and effectiveness of different management strategies over the next century, like reducing tourism and the spread of  【compressive,inclusive,invasive_,conclusive】 species. Under current management strategies and moderate warming, the team found 65 per cent of land plants and animals will decline by the end of the century. If warming is limited to below 2°C by 2100, the estimate drops to 31 per cent. “Everyone tends to think of Antarctica as this remote and  【unconventional,unpretentious,untouched_,uncontroversial】 wilderness that’s free of these threats that are facing the rest of the world,” says Lee, but the results suggest otherwise."

If water could not be brought via pipes, the Romans decided to bring it overland in what were conduits. When the water got to the city, it was fed off into smaller bronze or ceramic pipes. To get the water to flow at an even (and slow) pace, conduits were built on a slight slope. Valleys were crossed by using aqueducts. One of the most famous of these is the Pont du Gard aqueduct at Nimes in southern France. Where possible, the Romans did take water through tunnels but the hills needed to be relatively small for this to be successful. "

    "content": "Effective management involves four primary functions and related skill sets: planning, organizing, leading, and controlling. Although there’s a logical sequence to the functions, in practice the four functions are often performed in a dynamic manner. For example, a manager would need to develop or  【preference,occurrence,reference_,conference】 a departmental or organizational plan prior to executing on it just as you would reference a map prior to  【embarking_,executing,relying,bidding】 on a road trip. The proverb “if you fail to prepare you are preparing to fail”  【underfeeds,underscores_,understates,underlines】 the importance of this function. However, just as when road or airport closures or other factors might cause you to change your original route, unanticipated internal or external factors might cause a manager to revisit and revise the original plan, requiring a change in the other functions and  【depreciated,appreciated,random,associated_】 tasks. Thus, achieving organizational goals—arriving at your intended destination—requires ongoing management of the process and an understanding of the interrelationship of the four functions."

Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential). Mortality  【indicates,involves_,contributes,rotates】 causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population. Demographers most commonly study mortality using the Life Table, a statistical  【device_,factor,room,ingredient】 that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.\n\nMigration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations'  【though,however,unless_,but】 they are somewhat permanent. Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of  【commute,residence_,heath,life】, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.\n\nDemography is today widely taught in many universities across the world,  【exciting,exploring,illustrating,attracting_】 students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies."

The author of the book covered every aspect of Thomas Edisons life from the time his grandparents lived in the original Thirteen colonies to the point where he was born in Milan, Ohio and later up to the point where he died in 1931. Thomas Alva Edison was both a scientist and an inventor. When he was born in 1847, Edison would see  【spectacular,unnoticeable,tremendous_,minimal】 change take place in his lifetime. He was also to be responsible for making many of those changes occur. When Edison was born, society still thought of electricity as a  【invention,necessity,imagination,novelty_】, a fad. By the time he died, entire cities were lit by electricity.\n\nMuch of the credit for that progress goes to Edison. In his lifetime, Edison patented 1,093 inventions, earning him the nickname \"The Wizard of Menlo Park.\" The most famous of his inventions was the incandescent light bulb. Besides the light bulb, Edison developed the phonograph and the \"kinetoscope,\" a small box for viewing moving films. He also  【improved_,raised,changed,increased】 upon the original design of the stock ticker, the telegraph, and Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He believed in hard work, sometimes working twenty hours a day or more, depending upon the situation. Edison was quoted as saying, \"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\" In  【attribute,response,tribute_,memory】 to this important American, electric lights in the United States were dimmed for one minute on October 21, 1931, a few days after his death."

Behaviorism was a major change from previous theoretical perspectives, rejecting the emphasis on both the conscious and unconscious mind. Instead, behaviorism  【reproached,reproved,strove_,rewove】 to make psychology a more scientific discipline by focusing purely on observable behavior. Behaviorism had its earliest start with the work of a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov. Pavlov's research on the digestive systems of dogs led to his discovery of the classical conditioning process, which proposed that behaviors could be learned via conditioned associations. Pavlov demonstrated that this learning process could be used to make an  【acclimatization,association_,union,combination】 between an environmental stimulus and a naturally occurring stimulus.\n\nAn American psychologist named John B. Watson soon became one of the strongest advocates of behaviorism. Initially  【questioning,foreshortening,unburdening,outlining_】 the basic principles of this new school of thought in his 1913 paper Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It, Watson later went on to offer a definition in his classic book \"Behaviorism\" (1924), writing: \"Behaviorism...holds that the subject matter of human psychology is the behavior of the human being. Behaviorism claims that consciousness is neither a definite nor a usable concept. The behaviorist, who has been trained always as an experimentalist, holds, further, that belief in the existence of consciousness goes back to the ancient days of superstition and magic.\" "

Touring  【independently,arduously_,hardly,repeatedly】 for about five years after their proper full-length debut in 2008, they pretty much made their records on the go until 2013. So the band’s decision to be slow, deliberate, and thorough on their latest offering, Waltzed In From The Rumbling, represents a major change of pace. Finally sleeping in their in own beds while recording, the band assembled the album over the course of nine seasons. It’s a return to their origins, but it also pushes audaciously forward.\n\nThe aesthetic varies wildly and wonderfully from track to track, each song having its own hermetic seal but somehow still melding cohesively as a body of work. Jangling guitars, drums leaning toward the off- kilter swing of J Dilla, found sounds, a hint of shoegaze, and unorthodox instrumentation come together to keep the ear constantly  【involved,engaged_,contained,engaging】 with a feeling of constant evolution. They found an antique guiro next to a broken VCR and recorded both. They made an empty fridge sound like a timpani drum. They recorded gossip on a city bus. They brought in classical string flourishes. They sometimes left mistakes if they felt they were perfectly imperfect. It’s truly DIY, but with a feel of big production value that makes the album soar.\n\nContemplative lyrics anchor the album through all the exploratory  【wandering_,wondering,walking,strolling】 . The words are delivered melodically, belying their potency, but listening beyond the pretty aesthetic reveals piercing observations and an undeniable translation of feeling. The simplicity of the penetrating refrain on the three-part mini  【opus_,opulence,opaque,opalescence】 “Je Voulais Te Dire” is a paragon of how the lyrics effortlessly cut through the instrumentation. Guitarist/vocalist Warren Spicer sings “It’s only love, but you want it bad,” encompassing how we try to avoid and downplay our desire for love and affection, but ultimately search and long for it anyway."

In the last 50 years, the US and Canada have lost more than one-quarter of their birds – an estimated 3 billion animals – due to human activity.

They are  【uncommon,abnormal,surprising,unusual_】 for being the colour of charcoal and full of frothy bubbles. The diamonds, which can weigh in at more than 3,600 carats, can also have a face that looks like melted glass. Because of their  【seasonal,odd_,incidental,strange】 appearance, the diamonds are  【unsuitable_,incompatible,inapposite,unseemly】 as gemstones. But they do have industrial applications and were used in the drill bits that helped dig the Panama Canal. Now a team led by Stephen Haggerty of Florida International University in Miami has presented a new study suggesting that the odd stones were brought to Earth by asteroid billions of years ago.\n\nThe findings were published online in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters on December 20. The scientists exposed polished pieces of carbonado to extremely intense infrared light. The test revealed the presence of much hydrogen carbon bonds, indicating that the diamonds probably formed in a hydrogen—rich environment – such as that found in space. The diamonds also showed strong similarities to tiny nano diamonds, which are frequently found in meteorites. “They’re not  【similar,matching,identical_,alike】 ,” Haggerty said, “but they’re very similar.” Astrophysicists, he added, have developed theories predicting that nano diamonds form easily in the titanic stellar explosions called supernovas, which scatter debris through interstellar space. The deposits in the Central African Republic and Brazil, he said,  【doubtless,apparently,perhaps,probably_】 come from the impact of diamond rich asteroid billions of years ago, when South America and Africa were joined."

That’s because limitations on new tax credits  【abstracted,redacted,attracted,enacted_】 in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act won’t be put into force all at once, the Treasury Department announced this week.

    "content": "Earth’s continental crust may have emerged 500 million years earlier than scientists had previously estimated. Pinning down when our planet’s land emerged could help us understand the conditions in which  【primitive_,vegetation,primate,spatial】 life began. Today, new oceanic crust rises at mid-ocean ridges where tectonic plates drift apart. Continental crust is usually much older, formed from volcanism where plates crash into each other,  【everlasting,infesting,harvesting,thrusting_】 a thicker, less-dense layer above sea level. Weathering of continental crust adds  【evidence,waste,nutrients_,orients】 to the ocean, a process that may have played a role in supporting primordial life. The big question is: when did continental crusts start forming? To try to answer that, Desiree Roerdink at the University of Bergen in Norway and her colleagues analysed 30 ancient rock samples from six sites in Australia, South Africa and India. These contained barite, which can form in hydrothermal vents – fissures in the ocean floor  【which,where_,why,what】 warm, mineral-rich waters react with seawater."

A change  【around,in_,beyond,by】 the way symphony orchestras recruit musicians provide an unusual way to test for sex-biased hiring. To overcome possible biases in hiring, most orchestras revised their audition policies in the 1970s and 1980s. A major change involved the use of 'blind' auditions with a 'screen'  【to conceal_,to be concealed,concealing,concealed】 the identity of the candidate from the jury. Female musicians in the top five symphony orchestras in the United States were less than 5% of all players in 1970 but are 25% today. We ask whether women were more likely to be advanced and/or hired with the use of 'blind' auditions. Using data from actual auditions in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases by 50% the probability a woman  【would advance,will have advanced,will be advanced_,will advance】 out of certain preliminary rounds. The screen also enhances, by several fold, the likelihood a female contestant will be the winner in the final round. Using data on orchestra personnel, the switch to 'blind' auditions can explain between 30% and 55% of the  【amount,decrease,number,increase_】 in the proportion female among new hires and between 25% and 46% of the increase in the percentage female in the orchestras since 1970."

In The World Is Flat, Thomas Friedman (2005) argues that technology is a  【driving_,demeaning,distinguishing,demanding】 force behind globalization, while the other forces of social change (social institutions, population, environment) play comparatively minor roles. He suggests that we can view globalization as occurring in three distinct  【periods_,periodicals,perspectives,perceptions】 . First, globalization was driven by military expansion, powered by horsepower and windpower. The countries best able to take  【action,advantage_,account,care】 of these power sources expanded the most,  【exerting_,pushing,sparing,extending】 control over the politics of the globe from the late 15th century to around the year 1800. The second shorter period, from approximately 1800 CE to 2000 CE, consisted of a globalizing economy. Steam and rail power were the guiding forces of social change and globalization in this period. Finally, Friedman brings us to the post-millennial era. In this period of globalization, change is driven by technology, particularly the internet."

Artificial light is known to have detrimental effects on the ecology of sea turtles, particularly at the hatchling stage when they emerge from nests on natal beaches and head towards the sea.

But when physicist Lydéric Bocquet's 7-year-old son asked him why a good throw makes a stone skip on a lake instead of  【sinking_,debunking,plunking,sacking】 , Bocquet took the question as a challenge.

If the lift force is greater than the force of gravity then the stone bounces up; otherwise it sinks. Bocquet's physical model  【fears,found,bears_,digs】 out the conventional wisdom that the best skipping stones are flat and should be hurled nearly parallel to the water, fast and spinning. The stone's flatness maximizes the lift, as does its speed, which also provides energy to keep it bouncing along. These are the same factors that keep a water-skier from sinking, Bocquet says. Spin prevents the stone from tilting and hitting the water edge-first, just as fast rotations  【commercialize,stabilize_,nationalize,fertilize】 a bicycle or a spinning top."

    "content": "According to the literature, the history of vaccination can be traced back to as early as the 7th century when the monks in India tried to immunize themselves by drinking snake  【venom_,fluid,mucus,liquid】 . The first vaccination was inoculation with human smallpox, a practice widely carried out in ancient India, Arabia, and China. This method of vaccination consisted of collecting pus from a patient suffering from  【mild_,slight,moderate,severe】 form of smallpox virus infection and  【injecting,introducing,inoculating_,invading】 the sample to a healthy human, which later led to a minor infection.\n\nThis method was first introduced in England by a Greek named E. Timoni. However, this method had a risk of spreading smallpox in the community and even worsening the health condition of the person who received the inoculation.\n\nWhile the use of human smallpox vaccine was  【controversial_,confident,conscious,contemporary】 , E. Jenner came up with bovine smallpox vaccine in 1796; this new method also faced controversy, but continued to be  【constant,uniformed,universalized_,unique】 . Smallpox became a preventable disease by injecting pus extracted from a human infected with cowpox virus. Jenner named the substance \"vaccine\" after the Latin word \"vacca\" which means \"cow,\" and thus the process of giving vaccine became \"vaccination\"."

However, the importance students  【deliver,attach_,summon,acquire】 to estates decreases to 79% for third years students. The research also highlighted how factors such as demographics, region and type of university  【attached,attended_,acquired,augmented】 have an impact on how students view the university buildings. Students in Russell Group universities are much more likely to describe their buildings as 'inspiring', closely followed by students in newer universities such as Lincoln, Gloucestershire and Ravensbourne College. This pattern was repeated when students were asked to rate the overall quality and design of estate, with Russell Group students, and students from newer universities, more likely to rate the estates as excellent.  【Collective,Existing_,Predictable,Collateral】 data shows capital expenditure on estates has been the highest amongst the Russell Group universities during 2001-2011. When asked where they would invest money in their universities, the top three areas in order of  【prefer,preferential,prefect,preference_】 were: smaller class sizes, bursaries for poorer students and new buildings and facilities. When their expenditure options were restricted to estates-only items, the repair and  【ratification,annexation,benevolence,maintenance_】 of existing buildings came out top with 77%, which suggests that new buildings should not be at the  【rating,partisan,benefit,expense_】 of the rest of the estate, and may even highlight the deficiencies of tired and outmoded facilities.

The editorial,  【published_,publicized,tarnished,transmitted】 in 45  【countries_,continents,terraces,venue】 in 20 different languages, appears on this first day of the Copenhagen climate conference.
