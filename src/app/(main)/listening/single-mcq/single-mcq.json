    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nThere’s growing alarm over plunging insect populations with climate change, habitat destruction and pesticides all thought to play a role. But now, scientists say there’s another culprit: artificial streetlights. Researchers from the charity Butterfly Conservation counted caterpillars at the sides of brightly lit roads. Compared with similar stretches of unlit roads, caterpillar numbers were reduced by half, suggesting streetlights can affect the abundance of insects – at least on a local scale. The scientists say with insects in trouble, we should be doing all we can to reduce negative influences. But there are practical solutions such as dimming streetlights in the early hours, installing motion sensors, or using color filters to modify the light.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nThe first two years of a baby’s life are critical for brain development. In this study, parents were given video-based tips on how best to interact with their babies according to their particular needs. By the age of three, the baby still had some developmental difficulties, but their social skills had improved, and two thirds fewer met the criteria for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, compared to babies who received standard care. The research charity Autistica said the study was promising and people should not have to wait for a diagnosis for support to be provided. But the National Autistic Society said autism was not a disease that should be cured or lessened. The research team says longer term studies on more babies using the technique are now needed.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nResearch suggests ADHD is three to four times more likely to be detected in childhood in boys as they tend to exhibit more disruptive behaviors. The symptoms in girls tend to be more subtle: less hyperactive, more inattentive. The diagnoses gap between males and females appears to shrink in adulthood, but psychologists say the bias can remain. The ADHD Foundation says increased awareness is needed in health and educational settings about how the condition can present differently. A late diagnosis can negatively impact on relationships, careers, and mental health. In England, NICE guidance has been updated to make it easier for doctors to detect women and girls with ADHD. Work to improve neuro developmental services is underway in Scotland and Wales. But there are currently no dedicated services for adults with ADHD in Northern Ireland.###",

These two parties tend to reflect relatively moderate political views.\n\nBut there are several other smaller parties on the fringes, including the Libertarian, Constitution, Socialist or Green Parties. Or you can just be an independent not affiliated with any party. Third parties are not that big.

I would like to emphasize the consequences of isolation and loneliness the most, because it is no doubt an extremely important factor that affects both physical and mental health. People who spend a long time in isolation, like prisons or hospitals or Antarctica if you will, definitely lose certain social skills. And the longer they stay, the more they lose. Marchian Prohasko spent almost two months in Antarctica. He went there in early 2019 to write a book about the experience of being at a polar station.

If you want to do something about climate change, your home is among the most important places to look.\n\nCHARLES: Maybe it's hard to imagine a house releasing greenhouse gases just sitting there, but think about your daily routine. You stumble out of bed in the morning, turn on the lights, turn up the thermostat, take a shower, make some coffee or toast. The heat and the hot water may come from a furnace or a water heater that burn gas. They release carbon dioxide straight into the air, other kinds of pollution too actually. The lights and the coffee maker and the computer run on electricity, and that comes from power plants, most of which are still burning coal and gas.

    "question": "According to the financial therapist, why does a couple experience the inequality imbalance?###A) Because one is not bringing all the income and then feels that he or she should have more say.###B) One is anxious about money and so needs money to be a source of security.###C) Because one contributes more to the income and believes this gives more say.###D) One is unconcerned with money and so needs more money to consume.",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nMIGAKI: In your role as a financial therapist, you've got sort of a five-step process for something that you call financial intimacy. I'm wondering if you can help us define that and talk us through it.\n\nCLAYMAN: So with the first one, equality, what we want to capture here in a healthy financial dynamic is that both partners have equal say and equal power about what's going to happen with the money. So sometimes when a couple comes to me with an inequality imbalance, there's a partner that either has - maybe is bringing in the bulk of the income and then thus feels like they should have more say. Or sometimes there's a partner that's just more anxious about money and so really needs money to be a source of control for them and feels like their partner is just - in not agreeing with them and not doing what they say should be done with the money, that this is threatening to them. And they want their partner to kind of come to heel, if you will. So where I would approach that is, all right, well, we need to have both parties present in the decisions about the money. Just because you're more anxious or because you make more of a contribution to the income doesn't mean that you get an outsized say in this.###",

I had a boss who put so much thought and care into the way that she talked to me about my work, I felt like she was really invested, and I always felt better after talking to her and getting feedback. So really, constructive, actionable feedback is a gift. And in this episode, we're going to teach you how to give it.

That's just how dog mouths appear sometimes, right? Perhaps, but according to neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp of Bowling Green State University, some animals do laugh.\n\nWhen chimps play, Panksepp notes, they make panting sounds that could be a form of laughter. Even rats have a way of laughing - by chirping when they're playing with each other or being tickled by humans.\n\nBut, if animals do in fact laugh, what are they laughing at? Scientists have long known that for many animals, life isn't all about hunting, foraging, fighting, and sleeping. Young animals also play a lot, which suggests that animal laughter is related to playful joy.###",

All of my friends are from different backgrounds and make different salaries and have different values when it comes to saving and spending money, so I still don't know what the proper etiquette is when the bill comes. I haven't yet mastered the dance. And to make matters worse, since I moved to New York City, a lot of these insecurities have been turbocharged because this city is home to some super rich people. It's all very confusing, made nearly incomprehensible because we just don't talk about this kind of thing - I mean, not really.###",

It transports oxygen from the lungs to body tissue and carbon dioxide from body tissue to the lungs. It transports nourishment from digestion and hormones from glands throughout the body. It transports disease, finding substances to tissues and waste to the kidneys. Blood is alive because it contains living cells. Red blood cells and white blood cells are responsible for nourishing and cleansing the body. Since the cells are alive, they need nourishment. Vitamins and minerals keep the blood healthy blood cells have a definite life cycle, just as all living organisms do. Approximately fifty five percent of blood is plasma. A strong colored clear liquid liquid plasma carries the solid cells and platelets when the human body loses a little bit of blood through a minor wound. The blate let's help the blood clot so that the bleeding stops. You would bleed to death without the platelets. Your body is always making new blood inside your bones. When the human body loses a lot of blood through a major wound, that blood has to be replaced through a blood transfusion from other people. But everybody's blood is not the same. There are four different blood types plus your body has rh factors which make it even more unique. Blood received through a transfusion must match your own. Sometimes patients donate their own blood when they are scheduled to have major surgery so that they will have a perfect match. It is called an autologous blood donation.###",

I bet you all know that you aren't supposed to use your hands when you play soccer. It is called a handball violation. You cannot touch any part of the ball with your hands unless you are the goalkeeper. Only the goalkeeper can touch the ball with his hands. A handball violation includes using any part of the body from the fingers to the shoulders. Until here. This is all you know, now I want to ask you some questions. First, picture the situation in the middle of a game. A player kicks the ball and the ball touches the hand of the opposite team player, but he didn't touch it intentionally. Now, is it a handball violation? I want you to think about it. Here goes another question. What if the kicker did that intentionally? Is it a handball violation?###",

As we noted in our previous class. There was a fifteen year long war after julius caesar was assassinated. The war was severe, the number of injured was so many. There were so many that it became one of the top priorities of the new emperor. To give medical care to those in need. It was around this time that the new emperor augustus started thinking about upgrading the status of doctors. He realized that medical care was key to the empire, and especially an army. In order to improve the medical system, he needed better doctors. So he started making the profession look more enticing. All army doctors were entitled to attend the new army medical school and were given dignified titles, land grants and special retirement benefits. Before this, doctors had a fairly low status.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nOkay, class. Today i'm going to tell you about one of Picasso's greatest master pieces, Gornicka as you know, Gornicka is also the name of a basque town. In order to understand this picture, we need to go over some of the historical background of this town. The mass tone is a city located in northern spain. During the spanish civil war, the german air force bombed the city. It was a massive aerial bombardment of a civilian population. It happened since the nazis were helping spain's dictator francisco franco. Hundreds of civilians were killed in the raid. It shocked the world and this prompted picasso to begin painting. He completed it in less than two months and hung it in the spanish pavilion at the paris international exposition of eighteen thirty seven. The painting became a timely and predictive vision of the second world war. There is a complexity of symbolism in the painting. It does not portray the event directly instead, because so used imagery such as suffering people, animals and buildings wrenched by the violence. It certainly shows the chaos of carpet bombing. We can feel the in humanity, brutality and hopelessness of war from it. Picasso really expressed his outrage very well with this monumental painting. People say gornick a is the last great historical painting. It is now recognized as an international icon for peace. You can also see a tapestry copy of it displayed on the wall of the united nations building in new york city. It is often described as the most important work of art in the twentieth century, but its meaning is still beyond the understanding even of some of the most well known scholars.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. The professor is talking about stating laws in the science of psychology. Psychology is a relatively new science. Like other sciences, psychology must be able to state laws. A law is a way of organizing knowledge about something so that we can make predictions. When enough knowledge is gained about a subject, a scientist can state precisely what will happen under certain conditions. We experimental psychologists are interested in developing laws about human behavior, so we'll be able to understand and predict what people do and why they do it. Of course, to develop laws about human behavior, we must assume there's some regularity to it. We can't be psychologists without making assumption. The behaviour follows certain patterns. One of the major law psychology start escaping is called the law of effect. The law of effect states that whether or not a person will repeat a behavior depends on the effect that behavior has. If an action is rewarded, it's likely to be repeated. If the action is not rewarded, or if it's punished, IT's not likely to be repeated. How do psychologists state laws? First, using available knowledge, a psychologist makes a hypothesis about behavior. Then the psychologist tests the hypothesis through an experiment. But even if the experiment proves the hypothesis was correct, it's not yet a law. it's just the beginning of the work to arrive at a law that will apply to all humans. Many repetitions of the experiment must be conducted under different conditions. Only repeated verification, especially proof that the behavior can be predicted, will result in a law.###",

Notice how the straight lines of the chair differ from the curves of the violin. Once you are ready to begin drawing, define the shape of the chair with clean straight lines. Then add contrast by drawing the outline of the violin with gently curved lines. You may have to apply more pressure to the nib when drawing curved lines to allow the ink to flow easily. When you have drawn the outlines of both objects, add in the finer details, such as the seat of the chair.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nLand animals move easily through air, because air does not slow them down. Sea creatures, on the other hand, have to move through water, which is hundreds of times thicker than air. A sea animal has to push itself through water in order to move. Sea animals use many different ways to swim, creep or glide through water. Fish are able to swim by bending their bodies into waves. They have flattened fins and tails that push against the water, like, or blades converting their body waves into forward movement. The size of a fish's tail contributes to the swimming speed. Small tail fins are found in slow swimmers, like the eel. The medium sized tail of the base is linked with a medium to fast swimming speed. Long pointed tail lobes, like those on the marlin, are found only on fast swimmers. Sea mammals, like whales and dolphins, swim in a very fish like way, except for one important difference. Because their ancestors lived on the land. They developed tails that moved up and down. Whales and dolphins wave their tails up and down rather than side to side like fish do. The seahorse is a fish whose tail is not used for swimming at all. The seahorse uses its thin coil tail to attach itself to sea weed like a monkey's tail holds onto a tree branch. Squid is an octopus, is move in a completely different way. They use a type of jet propulsion, shooting water out through a nozzle to force themselves along. And then there are the creatures that live on the bottom of the sea. Sea slugs, limpets and whelk creep on a single flat piece of muscle called a foot. Ripples pass along the foot, which allows these animals to glide smoothly forward.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nThe origins of jazz are as richly textured as the music itself. The term jazz really covers many different kinds of music. In the late nineteenth century, african americans began performing the folk music known as the blues, whose origins lay in the work songs of slavery days. Within the african american community. The blues evolved into popular commercial music. In nineteen fourteen, a black orchestra leader named w c handy wrote the st. Louis blues, adapting the african american folk idiom to european convention of orchestration and harmony. Handy produced a hit song. The st. Louis blues was tremendously influential among black and white musicians, and handy style of music became famous under the name of jazz. Early jazz musicians were active in many cities and towns throughout the southern united states. It was new orleans with its long tradition of african american music that was the home of many fathers of jazz. After world war one, the musicians of new orleans joined the general northward migration of african americans. The first great national center of jazz was chicago. From there, the music entered the mainstream and even gave its name to the decade of the nineteen twenties. Jazz blending african american folk roots with elements of popular music and european classical traditions has been called america's classical music.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nListen to a lecture in a botany class. The professor is talking about plant hormones. The word hormone is derived from a greek verb. That means to excite hormones are found in all multicellular organisms and function to coordinate the parts of the organism. A hormone is a chemical signal. It's produced by one part of the body, and is then transported to other parts of the body, where it triggers responses in cells and tissues. The concept of chemical messengers in plants first emerged from a series of classic experiments on how plant stems respond to light. Think about this. A house plant on a window sill grows toward light. If you rotate the plant, it will soon reorient its growth until its leaves again face the window. The growth of a plant toward light is called photo tropism. In a forest or other natural ecosystem where plants may be crowded. Photo tropism directs growing seedlings toward the sunlight that powers photosynthesis. Some of the earliest experiments on photo tropism were conducted in the late nineteenth century by charles darwin and his son, francis, the darwin zablocki va, that a grass seedling could bend toward light only if the tip of the shoot was present. If the tip was removed, the shoot would not curve toward light. The seedling would also fail to grow toward light. If the tip was covered with an opaque cap, the darwin spur post the hypothesis that some signal was transmitted downward from the tip into the part of the stem that controlled growth. Later experiments by other scientists studying phototropism led to the discovery of chemical messengers that stimulated growth in the stem. These chemical messengers were hormones.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nTo listen to an art instructor talk about composition. Composition is the organization of shapes and forms into a hole and expressive hole. The elements of composition, line shape, tone and color need to be well arranged, need to be ordered, they need to be coherent, just like the words and phrases and sentences in a piece of writing. All paintings have a compositional element. Successful paintings sort of suggest the third dimension, the sense that the design goes beyond the picture frame a pictures. Unity, which includes the shapes, tones, and colors, is linked to what the artist has to say. The artists message is strongest when it's clear, a composition is better. If it says one thing strongly, then if it tries to say too many things, a crowded composition is sort of fussy and splintered, and lacks unity. Even a painting of a single object needs thoughtful composition. So the character of the object is present in every shape.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nTo the beginning of the talk now that the warmer weather and longer days are here, we are the only ones spending more time outdoors. This is an active time for bats as well. Migratory bats are now returning to the area, and young bats are starting to explore their environment. Young bats go off course, and this is when most people come into contact with them. Bats are a normal part of our environment and can even be a good thing. That's help keep down the insect population, especially mosquitoes. Normal bad activity includes sleeping during the daytime and becoming active and flying around in search of food at night, starting at dusk. It's unusual to see a bat during the day. Normal bats don't fly around in the daytime or lie or crawl on the ground. So if you encounter about like that, you should call the health department immediately. If you have bats in your attic or house contact a pest control agency, they do not kill the bats, but make recommendations on how to get the bats out of your home. You want to create a one way valve from your house to outside so they can get out, but can't come in to avoid having bats in your house altogether. Find all possible entry points into the house and close them by caulking or screening the gap. Bats can squeeze through a gap of one half inch. Bats are the most likely carriers of rabies in our area, and almost one hundred percent of rabies cases are fatal. Make sure your dogs and cats are vaccinated against rabies. If you should come in physical contact with a bat, it's important to get in touch with the health department or a doctor immediately. If possible, catch the bat so it can be tested for rabies number seven.###",

    "question": "Why does the professor discuss taking a client's case history?###A) To show that a client's past behavior assists in diagnosis###B) To compare the case histories of various clients###C) To explain why some clients lie and some tell the truth###D) To entertain the students with stories of unusual clients",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nIn order to know how behavior patterns can be changed, the clinical psychologist has to know what causes the client to behave the way he or she does. Identifying the cause is called diagnosis. In diagnosis, a psychologist uses two basic tools, interviews and psychological tests. Through interviews and tests, the psychologist tries to classify the problem to see if it falls into any non categories. A psychologist may also attempt to describe the client's personality in terms of how he or she deals with life, for example, some people like to lead, and some prefer to follow the lead of others. Some people are active and outgoing, while others are quiet and reflective. In a diagnostic interview, the psychologist takes the client's case history. This means learning how the client got along with parents, teachers, and friends, as well as how the person handle difficult situations in the past. Psychological testing is the other way that a psychologist tries to diagnose the clients problems. Clinical psychologists have developed tests that can help them learn about a person's intelligence and personality, as well as tests that show whether a person's behavior or perception is influenced by emotions, disabilities, or other factors. Personality testing is useful in discovering how the client tries to adjust to life. Personality tests can reveal unconscious feelings. The person is unable to talk about. This information can be important and could help shorten the length of treatment required.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nTrue to listen to part of a talk in a business management class. Management requires a great deal of energy and effort more than most people care to make. One factor that affects managers and inhibits their capacity to provide leadership is stress. Stress has lots of causes, work overload, criticism from workers, and can have negative health effects, including loss of sleep. It's a fact managers have to deal with stress. Some handle it by making time to be by themselves, must have some favorite place or pastime, a beach to walk on, maybe a stream to fish in or a game to play with the kids. It's important to have some form of rest and relaxation, creating art, working with your hands, gardening, playing sports. The list goes on. Rest doesn't always mean inactivity. For some people, exercise is rest.###",

    "question": "Why does the professor mention student culture?###A) To illustrate how culture involves shared ideas and behaviors###B) To encourage students to think critically about their culture###C) To compare the student culture of the past and the present###D) To give students ideas for conducting their own research",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a talk in anthropology class. The professor is discussing culture. What would human life be without culture? IT's impossible for us to imagine what we'd be like wIThout language, wIThout art or religion or technology. Over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, these aspects of our cultures have become as much a part of us as our anatomy and physiology. We have a lot in common with the people around us. In fact, the number of ideas we have in common with nearby people is very large. A complete list of shared ideas, for example, ideas we share with our own, the people around us. This list would include our ideas about what's right and wrong, what's beautiful and ugly and so on. Also our ideas about food, work, love, marriage, every aspect of our lives, even our rules about how to behave towards strangers, friends, animals on the earth. Think of a particular group of people. Any groups say, for example, college students, if you could take all the ideas and behaviors, all the tools and technology, all the things that college students share as a result of being in contact with each other, you'd have what anthropologists call student culture. So what you're saying is culture is sort of like a club. College students are a club. IT's because our experiences like we go to class, we do homework, we have our computers and cell phones, we hang out with other students. Sometimes we forget what the outside world is like. This is why this what we have in common with other students. IT's why our culture makes us feel like part of a club. Right? Um. Well, in a way, a culture is like a club. Neighboring cultures might share the same ideas and rules like neighbouring clubs do, but the comparison doesn't completely cut it. Think about it. A club has borders that we can define, but we run into trouble if we try to draw borders around a culture. Culture isn't a thing, IT's an idea. Still, even though the idea of culture is problematic, some of us believe that by continuing to study cultures, we will eventually be able to explain the similarITies and differences.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nThe professor is talking about economics in colonial new england. We know that in colonial new england, the native americans, compared to the european colonists, had a far greater knowledge of what resources in the environment could be eaten or made useful. Native americans used a wide range of resources for economic subsistence, and these resources were simply used by the family that acquired them. Only a few resources were accumulated for the purpose of showing a person's social status, for example, shells, furs, and ornaments of the hunt, excuse me, doctor, singer. But did they, um, did the native americans have a concept of wealth? The native americans believed a person's status came more from kinship and personal alliances than from stores of wealth. Their definition of need was what they needed to survive. So if they had food, clothing, and shelter, they considered themselves wealthy for the european colonists. On the other hand, resources in the environment were seen more as commodities, as goods that could be exchanged in markets. European economies, measured commodities in terms of money values. Abstract equivalence is that could be accumulated and could function as indicators of wealth and social status. So for the colonists need was defined by the markets that bought new england goods. So the europeans perceived few resources in new england ecosystems, but they saw many commodities for fish timber, which could be sold in the market place for profit number.###",

If you don't take preventative measures today, we'll go over what some of these hazards are, and more importantly, what can be done about them. One major complaint may be the biggest complaint of people who spend time at the computer is eyestrain. To help ease the strain on the eyes, the computer screen should be about two feet from your eyes. The entire screen should be in focus. The brightness and contrast should be adjusted for best readability. A good way to relieve eyestrain is to look away from the screen, frequently focus your eyes on objects that are far away, like something outside the building across the street, or the tree in the parking lot. But what if your office doesn't have a window? I mean, i've worked in lots of places where there's no window, then in that case you need to get up and walk around. You should never sit for more than thirty minutes at a time. Anyway, this is important for the rest of your body as well.

    "question": "Which type of volcano is associated with the geysers in Yellowstone National Park?###A) Caldera###B) Shield###C) Cinder cone###D) Bomb",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nA volcano is event in the earth, which erupts when hot liquefied rock or magma moves to the earth's surface, pouring out as lava. The latter may flow out as a liquid, or it may explode from the vent as solid or liquid particles accompanied by superheated gases. Ash and cinders form a cone around the vent. There are several types of volcanoes. The most fluid magnus erupt quietly and flow from the vent to form gently sloping shield volcanoes. The name shield volcano comes from their resemblance to the shields of early germanic warriors. The lava flows from shield volcanoes are usually only one to ten meters thick, but may extend for great distances from the vent. The volcanoes of hawaii and iceland are typical volcanoes of this type. Cinder cone. Volcanoes are formed when magnus, with high gas contents and high viscosity are blown high into the air. During an eruption, the magma falls as volcanic bombs, which accumulate around the vent and form steep sided cones called errors. Large basin, like depressions, are formed when a violent eruption blows the top off of an existing cone, or when the center of a volcano collapses. One famous called era covers much of yellowstone national park. Six hundred thousand years ago, there was a huge volcanic explosion which devastated the landscape. At the center, there remained only a smouldering caldera, a collapsed crater more than forty miles wide. Yellow stones, famous geysers and hot springs lie within this giant basin.###",

    "question": "Why is the term \"tidal wave\" inaccurate for a tsunami?###A) Tides cause only the worst tsunamis.###B) Tsunamis occur only at high tide.###C) Waves do not have enough force to kill.###D) Tsunamis are not related to tides.",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nTalk in an earth science class. The professor is talking about tsunamis. The term tidal wave is often inaccurately used for a tsunami. Soon, armies have nothing to do with the action of tides. A more accurate term is seismic sea wave. There has to be a disturbance of the earth's crust to produce a tsunami. Large earthquakes with epicenters under or near the ocean are the cause of most tsunamis. Volcanic eruptions and undersea landslides are also responsible. But unless accompanied by movements of the ocean floor, their effects are usually localized. Possibly this was true about the eruption of krakatau a in eighteen eighty three, as soon army was responsible for most of the deaths caused by crack at our yet this soon army did not sink any ships. It did wash away several coastal villages and kill more than thirty six thousand people. Tsunamis work in complex ways. Some pounce on coastal settlements, like large breakers. Others produce a gentle wave that floats buildings off their foundations. But then a violent backwash may sweep buildings and people out to sea. The tsunami that wrecked hilo, hawaii, in nineteen forty six was so forceful, it folded parking meters. It caused needless deaths. When people return to save their belongings and got caught between waves, the deeper the water, the lower the tsunami, and the faster it moves. In the open ocean. It travels at about seven hundred kilometers per hour, but being sometimes know more than a metre in height, as soon, army often passes a ship unnoticed. This is what happened in eighteen ninety six during a catastrophic tsunami in japan, which was the result of an undersea earthquake. Thousands of people were drowned on shore, while fisherman far out at sea didn't notice the waves passing beneath their boats. But when they went home, they found their villages destroyed.###",

Also, work can be shared and it tends to produce more creative solutions to problems.\n\nHowever, we should be aware that conflicts may occur as individuals negotiate their place in the group and different personalities try to work together. To help overcome potential conflicts, the group can define the major task they need to complete, and then break the larger group objective into smaller tasks.

There is evidence to show that some whales. for example, died when they beached themselves after being exposed to excessive sonar - the noise produced by submarines as they navigate underwater. It's been shown that whales produced louder sounds when communicating with each other when sonar equipment was on in their vicinity. This was doubtless because they needed to make themselves heard by their fellows, perhaps to warn each other of danger, or tell one another about a food source.

Forget about grand themes and ethical content, whatever, for the moment and ask if the author writes badly or well. So, writing can be taught through reading, through literature.

    "question": "What made the speaker take up geology as a profession?###A) The fact that he can travel to interesting places.###B) Because he sees geologists as detectives.###C) His childhood interest in fossils.###D) He regards building a picture of an unknown country as exciting work.",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nI suppose the reason I got into geology was, well, as a kid I was fascinated by fossils - the fact that they went back countless years, long before there were any people on the planet. That was exciting and, urn, they were beautiful too. And one thing led to another. What fascinates me ... let me give you an example: suppose we dredge up from the sea floor some silt washed down by a river and, um, suppose that for political or other reasons we can't enter the country through which that river runs. Well, by careful study of the particles of that silt, we can form a pretty accurate picture of the nature of that country. Not just the rocks, 1mean, but the vegetation and animal life of the area. I sometimes think what we do is a bit like, urn, Sherlock Holmes. You know, he takes a look at a man's shoes and can tell you which field in which county in England he's been in, and when. That sort of detective aspect of the work is always interesting and exciting. OK. we do spend time in the lab and at the computer, but we do get out and about, and go to interesting places for fieldwork.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nThe nature-nurture debate is still going on. It is not a question of\n\ntaking sides because we know that both play an important part in what makes us who we are. It is more a question of emphasis - which of them has the greatest influence.\n\nOn the nature side, we have what we get from our genes, our inherited traits - eye color and other physical traits, for example, but also, some believe, non-physical ones, such\n\nas temperament. For example, you might be quick to anger, or have\n\na nervous temperament, and this even extends to sense of humor. On the nurture side, there is what we get from our environment and our upbringing, what we learn.\n\nResearch inlo the human genome has recently made it clear that\n\nboth sides are partly right. Nature gives us inborn abilities and traits while nurture takes these genetic tendencies and shapes them as we grow and learn and mature. This is an important point as it means, contrary to the belief of some, that we are not wholly determined by our genes. Scientists have known for years that eye and hair color are determined by specific genes, but some now claim that such traits as intelligence and personality are also encoded in our genes.###",

    "question": "According to the text, which of the following statements is true about stress?###A) Most people with stress-related problems do not consult their doctor.###B) A tolerance for stress is easily acquired.###C) Stress levels depend on the kind of job you have.###D) Working long hours can also contribute to stress.",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nIn small doses, stress can have quite a positive effect. It can make you feel more alive, even exhilarated. I suppose everyone has a set level at which stress becomes unbearable, at which point they cease to function properly. I suppose, too, that it's possible for someone to train themselves to be able to take higher levels of stress by repeatedly putting\n\nthemselves in a stressful situation\n\n- to build up a tolerance for stress. Indeed, some jobs absolutely require this. But stress is a fact of life for all of us and, as the figures show, its effect is largely negative.\n\nEach year, about six million people in Britain consult their doctors because they feel stress or anxiety, and it is estimated that at least another six million suffer from stress-related illness but do not seek medical advice. Long working hours, fear of losing their jobs,\n\nthe difficult journey to and (rom work in crowded trains and buses, all contribute to increased levels\n\nof stress. Then there are domestic problems, such as a large mortgage on the house, children who want to drop out of school and join rock bands, not enough time to spare to be with the family.###",

    "question": "Which of the following is not mentioned as being a type of genre fiction?###A) mainstream###B) gothic###C) fantasy###D) romance",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nThe division of literary works into genres - or texts thot deal with a particular subject, or a subject in a particular way - makes life easier for the person browsing in a bookshop. He or she can go directly to where their favorite kind of book is shelved, be it science fiction, gothic, romance, and so on. Many writers of genre fiction are immensely popular and successful, Stephen King and J. K. Rawling to name only two. But, for the most part, such writers aren't depicting the world we live in and are writing fantasies. However, some genre writers, particularly writers of detective and police fiction, are unhappy about being categorized in this way. Genre fiction, they say, has come to be seen as inferior to what is called mainstream or literary fiction. In other words, detective fiction isn't taken seriously as literature, and yet crime novels do deal with the raw stuff of everyday life. They are, in fact, closer to the harsh reality of the modern world than most mainstream fiction.\n\nBut, the critics say, while they do deal with the usual stuff of novels - character, emotion, psychology, social comment, and so on - it seldom goes very deep, and besides, most detective fiction, like certain mass-produced romantic novels - though not to anywhere near the same extent - follow a formula.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nThe basic English person's diet\n\nin medieval times was made up of bread, cheese and beef, while ale was the drink for all ages\n\nand social classes except for the aristocracy, who drank wine. In winter there were no root crops to feed the animals, so they were killed in autumn and the meat salted to preserve it. People kept livestock even in the towns: cows were usually kept tied or tethered, but pigs were allowed to wander at will, feeding on the rubbish off the streets.\n\nBy the 16th century, however, choice in foodstuffs had grown, including exotic spices to add flavor to the usual diet. This had come about because European rulers wanting\n\nto increase their power and wealth and also, in fairness, in the spirit\n\nof enquiry and the quest for knowledge, had financed voyages of exploration overseas.\n\nThis opened up trade routes, bringing precious spices - and\n\nvast profits - from the East, and to the west Spanish and Portuguese explorers had brought back such novelties as potatoes, tomatoes, maize, peppers and chocolate. It must be said, though, that it took people some time to accept some of these new foods, as they feared they were poisonous.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nSigns advertising business premises have been around for thousands of years and were used in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome to attract customers; and they often used symbols to illustrate what kind of business it was - for example, bushes or branches of ivy meant the place was a tavern. Both of these, the tavern and its sign, were introduced into Britain by the Romans in the first half of the 1st century AD. In Europe in the Middle Ages signs became more common. Then, in the 14th century, English merchants were obliged to have them outside their shops. However, the fashion was to have large swinging signs hung from a strut sticking out of the wall - and many public houses still have such signs - but so many accidents occurred, mostly involving people on horseback, that in the 17th century a law was brought in requiring shopkeepers to mount their signs flat against the wall of the premises, where they could do no harm.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nMap-making has a long and fascinating h istory - both before Ptolemy produced the first great map of the world and after, up to the beautiful simplicity of the London Underground map and the precisely-detailed Ordnance Survey maps, which cover almost every inch of the United Kingdom.\n\nAncient map-makers used to draw in hills, valleys and rivers to give an idea of the topography, the shape of the land. It wasn't until the late 16th century that contour lines were used - that is, lines that linked points of the land at the same height - but this was to show the relative depths and shallows of a river. The first time land contours were used was on a map of France, which took about forty years to complete, and was finished in 1783. The Ordnance Survey was set up in 1791 and their maps, as the name suggests, were originally made for military purposes, and the first one to be produced was of the county of Kent at a ratio of one inch to one mile.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nE###Transcript:\n\nIt is claimed, by neuroscientists among others, that speaking two or more languages increases cognitive abilities and in some way re-wires the brain, as it were, in a way that positively affects how the brain works. And it's true that we tend to think of people who can speak two or more languages as being bright. Learning a language is, anyway, good mental exercise, not to mention its benefits in introducing you to other peoples and cultures. This is why all school curricula should include at least one compulsory language. Anyone who knows two languages will find thai, in certain circumstances, they compete for position, the vocabulary of one getting in the way of the other. Often bi- or multilingual people find one language more suitable for expressing certain kinds of thoughts or feelings.\n\nThere is another view on being bilingual, not from a neuroscientist, but from someone whose business involves words and language. Brought up in a bilingual home, speaking Greek and French, and also fluent in English, she is old enough to remember when her native language, Greek, was also in effect two languages. There was the formal, correct form, kathareuousa, which was taught and spoken in schools, written in newspapers and books, and so on, and the everyday demotic language you used with your friends. As for her view on bilingualism, she says that you end up with a split personality.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nRandall Jarrell, the great American critic and poet, once defined the novel as, \"an extended piece of prose fiction with something wrong with it\". Now, nothing is perfect and you don't have to look very hard to find something wrong- or perhaps just something you don't like - about any work of fiction you care to name. Where, we might ask, does the editor come into this? And is it beneficial to an author to have an editor who is also a novelist? You would think that being a writer themselves, familiar with the process of writing a novel and its demands, they would be able to get inside the head of the author, and be sympathetic and understanding of what needs to be done. This is not an unreasonable assumption to make. However, is it not possible that there is an opposite side to this? Editors might, from their experience as writers, possibly unconsciously, try to make over the submitted novel as they themselves would have written it. The ideal, one supposes, is for the editor to see the book through the author's eyes, but if they apply their own creative talent to the job they might end up seeing it too much through their own eyes and, in this way, take no account of the author's original intentions.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nHow would you define \"reasonable\" as it is used in law? For example, you are allowed to use \"reasonable force\" when defending yourself. It seems to depend on how serious the situation was, whether it was possible to resolve it by peaceful means, whether you were ready to try those means and, finally, the relative strengths of those involved. Now, most men know, and they've probably grasped this from their earliest years in the school playground, that, when it comes to blows, fights don't stop until one of you is in no shape to do any damage to the other. The criteria mentioned seem a bit fuzzy to me. How can you convince a jury you were ready to try and talk your way out of it when the other person would have none of it and, besides, he was quick to land the first punch? Also you can strike the first blow and still plead self-defence.\n\nOf course, you again have the problem of convincing people that the threat was so great that you had no alternative, apart from getting beaten up yourself. Reacting calmly and rationally to a perceived threat is not easy to do.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nIt is not often I get the chance to talk about the psychology of pop music, or rather the lyrics and the effect they have on young people. I must say at the outset that I'm not at all sure about the findings of a recent survey I've been studying, conducted over a period of 30 years. In short, it claims that late adolescents and college students are more narcissistic than ever before. This might well be true, and it might also be true that pop lyrics are becoming more self-absorbed, negative and violent. But this reflect the psychology of the writers and performers more than their listeners. Also, as the writers of the study are alarmed to discover, this radical increase in narcissism comes with higher levels of and depression which, if you think a bout it for a second, is hardly surprising. Furthermore, they have detected a link with heightened anger and problems maintaining relationships. Now, a couple of points: first, adolescents are pretty much self-absorbed anyway, but it's rarely pathological; also, you can_read almost anything you want into song lyrics from any era. Again, people nowadays find it easier to express themselves emotionally than thetr counterparts did 30 years ago. Last, the survey suggests a complete . personality change over the covered, yet I doubt that personality traits can change so much from one generation to another or, for that matter, from one culture to another.###",
