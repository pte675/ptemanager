    "question": "Space inside our arteries is fully utilized. At every heartbeat, a higher blood pressure literally compacts millions of red blood cells into massive trains of oxygen that quickly flow throughout our body. And the tiny space inside our red blood cells is not wasted, either. In healthy conditions, more than 95 percent of their oxygen capacity is utilized. The reason blood is so incredibly efficient is that our red blood cells are not dedicated to specific organs or tissues; otherwise, we would probably have traffic jams in our veins. No, they’re shared. They’re shared by all the cells of our body. And because our network is so extensive, each one of our 37 trillion cells gets its own deliveries of oxygen precisely when it needs them. Blood is both a collective and individual form of transportation.",

    "question": "Tissue engineering, what is it? It's an emerging field, interdisciplinary field that combines engineering and life sciences to create functional biological structures that can restore and improve tissue function. Examples include bladders, trachea blood vessels and if you look at it, printing as a technology has also gone through the revolution and well it's been around for hundreds of years. In the last couple of decades, it's been a new dimension. We can now print layer by layer in materials ranging from plastic to metal, to concrete, to chocolate, from the smallest scales to the largest. If you take 3D printing and we combine it with biology, we have bio-printing where the building blocks our cell aggregates where we called bio-ling particles that are composed of thousands of cells that can fuse together into different shapes. These geometries can include multi-layered sheets, such as skin, branching tubes for vasculature and the sophistication of this manufacturing technology improves daily to include different cell types and different shapes. And now why is it important, the pharmaceutical industry at the moment is in a moment of crisis. It spends more money each year on R&amp;D, but has fewer drugs to show for it.

Darwin arrived in Brazil in 1832, and began documenting the enormous biodiversity of the rainforest of Rio de Janeiro province. In his diary, he mentions parasite plants like the lianas and bromeliads that hang from trees. After observing the differences between mockingbirds on the Galapagos Islands and elsewhere in Latin America, the scientist began to develop his Theory of Evolution. His work would change the way most people think about nature and the origins of humans. Now two hundred years after his birth, a great-great-grandson of Darwin is retracing his steps in Brazil. The expedition organized by Rio’s Federal University visited twelve municipalities in Rio de Janeiro state, inaugurating signs along the path of Darwin’s voyage. At one of the first stops, visitors were treated to a performance of capoeira, a combination of dance and martial-art-style fighting. On many occasions, Darwin writes about the cruelties of slavery, which was only abolished in Brazil in 1888.",

For instance, e-commerce in China is soaring. It’s been growing at twice the speed of the United States and a lot of the growth is coming from mobile. Every month, 500 million consumers are buying on mobile phones, and to put that into context, that is a total population of the United States, UK and Germany combined. But it is not just about the scale of the e-commerce, it is the speed of adoption and the aggregation of the ecosystems. It took China less than five years to become a country of mobile commerce, and that is largely because of the two technology platforms, Alibaba and Tencent. They own 90 percent of the e-commerce — pretty much the whole market — 85 percent of social media, 85 percent of internet payment. And they also own large volumes of digital content, video, online movie, literature, travel information, gaming. When this huge base of mobile shoppers meets with aggregated ecosystems, chemical reactions happen. Today, China is like a huge laboratory generating all sorts of experiments.

    "question": "The crushed stones that line railroad tracks are collectively called track ballast. More specifically, the track ballast constitutes the track bed upon which sleepers or railroad ties are laid. As you may have seen, these stones are packed below, between and around the railroad ties. The thickness of the track ballast usually ranges between 25-30 cm, and varies depending on certain conditions pertaining to the geographical location of the railway track. Track ballast usually consists of crushed rocks or stone, but in some cases, less suitable alternatives, like burnt clay, are also used. However, it's important to understand that you can't just throw a bunch of rocks on a railroad and be done with it. As mentioned, the stones in the track ballast have a characteristic shape, size and texture. Their surface is not smooth and their edges are jagged, and for good reason. These rocks interlock with each other and therefore stay in place. If you replace them with circular or smooth rocks, they would slide over each other and compromise the strength of the track ballast. As you might imagine, this can have catastrophic results. Railway tracks are made of steel and other metallic parts that are prone to corrosion and rusting, as they are constantly exposed to the forces of nature, including extreme heat from the sun, rain, vegetation and general wear and tear. The primary reason behind the existence of track ballast is to protect the railway track.",

It's classically defined as any long term living together of unlike organisms. Let me say that again symbiosis the long term living together of unlike organisms. Mutualistic symbiosis or mutualism is when both partners benefit from the relationship, like we saw in the clownfish and the anemone. When I say that both partners benefit from their relationship, what I mean is that both organisms experience a significant increase in evolutionary fitness. They both end up being better at surviving and reproducing. Parasitic symbiosis or parasitism is when one benefits while the other is harmed. Ticks, huh, are a good example of a parasite.

It's a sort of hangout for useful bacteria needed to help us digest food. After a bad case of diarrhea, when most of the bacteria in our guts is washed out, the appendix sends a fresh batch in to take over. D: Right. And not only that, but a more recent study has found that the appendix has a long and storied history. It's been around in animals including kangaroos, rodents and apes for at least eighty million years. In other words, it's fairly common in nature. Y: Now, it's true that in developed countries with modern sanitation, the human appendix has less to do than it once did. In those places, where diarrhea isn't a major problem, the appendix isn't called upon all the time to do its thing.

    "question": "Bird brains are tiny - the common pigeon's is about the size of a peanut. But having smaller noggins doesn't mean birds are unintelligent. One way scientists estimate brain power is through the number of neurons present. Some birds have upwards of 1-2 billion - similar to monkeys. The intelligence of birds - from New Zealand parrots that understand probability, to ravens that can plan for the future - isn't a surprise to researchers who have long seen their capabilities. Early models proposed that only a small region of bird brains was responsible for complex behaviors, but this has been revised in recent years. Still, the detailed, internal organization of bird brains hadn't been explored until now. Two new studies in Science dig into their structure and function, revealing even greater similarities to mammalian brains. Researchers shined different angles of light into extremely thin slices of the pallium, the area of bird brains with a similar function to the neocortex of mammals. This allowed them to see a 3D view of the fibers that connect neurons. The fibers of owls and pigeons were organized much like those of mammals: parallel fibers along the pallium were crosscut by perpendicular fibers between layers, forming columns of connection. These microcircuits could explain how birds are capable of complex behaviors.",

What Aristotle's ethical theory is all about is this: he's trying to show you how to be happy — what true happiness is. Now, why is he interested in human happiness? It's not just because it's something that all people want to aim for. It's more than that. But to get there we need to first make a very important distinction. Let me introduce a couple of technical terms: extrinsic value and intrinsic value. To understand Aristotle's interest in happiness, you need to understand this distinction. Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. If I value something as means to something else, then it has what we will call \"extrinsic value\", other things we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone. If we value something not as means to something else, but for its own sake, let us say that it has \"intrinsic value\", exercise. There may be some people who value exercise for itself, but I don't. I value exercise because if I exercise, I tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn't. So I desire to engage in exercise and I value exercise extrinsically ... not for its own sake, but as a means to something beyond it. It brings me good health.",

It appeared that malaria organism was more readily able to attach to red cells that were type A or type B, and actually kill those patients before they have a chance to reproduce. Those people who had type O actually would get sick, but wouldn’t die, and had an opportunity to reproduce, and that’s how the gene goes forward. And then, if you look at a map of where malaria is now and where the different peoples are, you can see that the type O was followed, there is where there's malaria, A and B has gone to colder climates where malaria wasn’t a problem, and then AB was just, you know, combination of the races.”",

    "question": "What is precipitation? Clouds hold millions of tiny water droplets. Over time, a cloud can hold more and more tiny droplets of water and pieces of ice. Wind and hot temperature make the droplets and pieces bump into each other. They then group together; they get bigger and heavier until they are too heavy to stay in the cloud. They fall to the ground as something called precipitation. Precipitation can include rain, snow, hail or sleet. Precipitation can form into different types. This is because the differences in temperatures. If the air between the cloud and the ground is warm, the precipitation will fall as rain. If the rain freezes between the cloud and the ground, it becomes sleet. If the air is in the cloud and it blows very cold, the precipitation will fall as snow. Hail forms when ice crystals get blown upward inside of a cloud over and over. The ice will get bigger and bigger each time until it finally falls from the sky. Sleet is smaller than hail. Sleet falls in cold weather. Precipitation comes from storms. Thunderstorms are the most common type storm. They are caused when warm, wet air hits cold, dry air. The warm, wet air rises fast to form huge clouds.",

    "question": "Current studies show that what goes on labels is an important consideration for manufactures since more than 70 percent of shoppers read food labels when considering whether to buy a product. A recent controversy as to whether labels on prepared foods should educate or merely inform the consumer is over and a consumer group got its way. The group maintained that the product labels should do more than simply list how many grams of nutrients food contains. Their contention was that labels should also list the percentage of a day's total nutrients that the product would supply to the consumer because this information is essential in planning a healthy diet. A government agency disagrees strongly favoring a label that merely informs the consumer. In other words, a label that only lists the contents of the product. The agency maintained that consumers could decide for themselves if the food is nutritious and is meeting their daily needs. The consumer group in supporting its case has cited a survey in which shoppers were shown a food label and with an ask if they would need more or less of a certain nutrient after eating a serving of this product. The shoppers weren't able to answer the questions easily when they were not given a specific percentage.

This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, 'think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of 'sea coal. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by 'self-regulation' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.The next stage was prompted by the Industrial Revolution with the urbanization of society and its profound effects on the environment. Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximize their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of 'Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good. Those industrialists who were concerned for either the health of their employees or the local environment faced higher costs than their competitors.

These species compete with native wildlife for resources, and thrive at the expense of the local ecosystem. The introduction of invasive species is often associated with human activity. Boats that travel between different bodies of water can carry hitchhikers, such as the zebra mussel. One of the most notorious invasive species in the United States, these rapidly reproducing mussels, clog pipes, and over take beaches in the Great Lakes. Some invasive species, however, are introduced intentionally. In the early 20th century, cane toads were brought to Australia as a form of pest control. Today, these poisonous amphibians number in the millions and have cause a decline in native predators on the island. It's not just animals. Bacteria, fungi, and plants can also become invasive. Brought to South Africa in the 19th century, the black wattle is an invasive tree often used for timber and firewood.

    "question": "About 71% of the earth's surface is covered in water, and we can harness some of it to create energy. The two most common water energy technologies are hydropower and tidal power. Hydropower is electrical energy derived from falling or running water. The movement of the water turns the blades of a turbine, which is connected to a generator, which produces electricity. Hydropower is the most commonly used form of renewable energy. Tidal power converts the natural rise and fall of the tides into electricity using variety of technologies including tidal fences, garages and turbines. Additionally, wave power can be harnessed to capture energy from waves on the surface of the ocean using a special buoy. Energy from water is considered a renewable energy resource because it uses the Earth's water cycle and gravitational pull to generate electricity. It also does not directly emit greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants. However, depending on the water energy technology, negative environmental land-use impacts can be an issue. Water is also heavily used in energy production processes. For example, water is used in power generation to generate steam, cool nuclear thermal plants, extract and process fossil fuels, and to irrigate biofuel crops.",

And yet, did you know that watches and clocks were scarce in the United States until the 1850's? In the late 1700's, people didn't know the exact time unless they were near a clock. Those delightful clocks in the squares of European towns were built for the public. After all, most citizens simply couldn't afford a personal timepiece. Well into the 1800's in European and the United States, the main purpose of a watch, which, by the way, was often on a gold chain, was to show others how wealthy you were. The word \"wristwatch\" didn't even enter the English language until nearly 1900. By then the rapid pace of industrialization in the Unites States meant that measuring time had become essential. How could the factory worker get to work on time unless he or she knew exactly what time it was? Since efficiency was now measured by how fast a job was done, everyone was interested in time.

Temperatures plummeted, rain levels fell and a massive ice sheet slowly advanced to cover most of northern Europe and stay there for the next few thousand years. We know that during this glacial period, many animal and plant species sought shelter in Europe's three warmer southern peninsulas, Iberia, Italy, and the Balkans. But the question is, where did the people go? Archeological material recovered from this time period has shown that a large number of our ancestors retreated to Franco Cantabria, an area covering the southwest of France and the northeastern tip of Spain. But was this the only area where people traveled to escape the worst of the weather? Let's go back to the growing ice sheet. In order to grow, the ice mass had to take up water, causing sea levels to fall. At its maximum when the ice reached as far south as Germany, sea levels were up to 120 meters lower than today. That's approximately the same height as the London Eye. As a result, areas of the shallow sea became exposed and Europe's shape was very different from the one we recognized. It could be that humans lived on these exposed shores during the Paleolithic, but we have no evidence of their settlements because it's now we're underwater.",

This includes things like cultural and social norms, so kind of understanding how you are supposed to behave in a classroom or expecting a certain thing to happen when you walk into a restaurant. These are all things that we have learnt and acquired over our years but it’s not necessarily something that we think about.

A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems, because I think there are some very important problems that don't get worked on naturally. That is, the market does not drive the scientists, the communicators, the thinkers, the governments to do the right things. And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to. So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand. But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist. Any tough problem, I think it can be solved. And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past. Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled. Another statistic, perhaps my favorite, is to look at childhood deaths. As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born, and 20 million of those died before the age of five. Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more -- and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five. So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate. It's a phenomenal thing. Each one of those lives matters a lot.",

    "question": "As you have probably noticed, fashions and tastes change quite noticeably over the years, most obviously perhaps in clothes, hairstyles and popular music. The reputations of writers and artists are no different, though the alternating periods of being in and then out of fashion are longer. A poet may no longer appeal to a large reading public for a number of reasons, though we must keep in mind that poetry is a minority taste and its readership is relatively small in the first place. So, um, I want to look at the reputation of Alexander Pope. In his own lifetime, he was praised and idolized by both his friends and the literary world in general, though he did have some rather vicious enemies. Yet both friends and enemies seemed more concerned with either praising or attacking his character and morals than with properly assessing the poems themselves. The Romantics, of course, had little time for him. Indeed, the Romantic movement, in poetry at least, was an attempt to make a complete break with the strict formality and rationality of the Augustan poets, of whom Pope was the most notable example. They did not regard him as a real poet and complained of his ignorance of nature in the sense of mountains, trees, and flowers. The Victorians were even less responsive to Pope and this was probably the period when his reputation was at its lowest. In fact, it wasn't until the 1920s that Pope and the Augustan poets were re-evaluated, and given the attention and respect they deserved.",

South American fishermen in the 19th century describing warmer waters during Christmas time, coined the name El Nino, Spanish for the Blessed child. Nowadays, when sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean rise point 5 degrees Celsius over their historic average for three consecutive months, and once atmospheric conditions and rainfall patterns shift accordingly, scientists officially declare an El Nino. An El Nino event takes place about every two to seven years. Normal east to west trade winds over the Pacific weaken and warm water that normally travels westward is now moving toward the east. Moisture then rises into the air and the effects of El Nino are felt throughout the Americas. In the ocean, warm water pushes colder water downward, blocking the important upwelling of nutrient-rich waters from the bottom. This causes some marine life to migrate to colder waters.

And these contests can be a sign of serious organizational dysfunction. Not only do they leave women out or force them to play in a rigged system of ridiculous rules, they also short circuit teamwork, decrease innovation, and hurt the bottom line with employee turnover or harassment lawsuits. Researchers found four masculine norms that correlate strongly with organizational dysfunction. One, show no weakness. Swagger and overconfidence suppress vulnerability, uncertainty, and tenderness. Two, strengthen stamina. Even in white-collar jobs, physical strength and athleticism are prized and endurance is proven by working late into the night. Three, put work first. Commitment to the organization comes before all else, leaving no room for family, breaks, or balance.

Before reversing direction, the summer solstice, the sun would appear at its highest point in the sky, and is the day with the longest period of daylight. It happens twice a year, once in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The summer solstice in the northern hemisphere occurs around the 21st of June, but it does not always occur on this day. As it all depends on when the sun reaches its northernmost point from the celestial equator, it can happen between the 20th to the 22nd of June. Around this time in areas north of the arctic circle, it is possible to witness the sun not set at all, so a dubbed land of the midnight sun for this very reason. This occurs because the earth's rotational axis is tilted. The earth rotates around an axis inclined at an angle of 23.5 degrees in relation to its orbital plane around the sun.

Color in short hand that says to a bee: hey, I get some good quality nectar here, want to stop by for a visit. But new findings show that bees also use color to get clues about a flower’s temperature. And according to a study from a British research team published in the journal Nature, some like it hot. Bees use up a lot of energy just stay in warm on some days. In fact, they can’t even fly if they are too cold. So if one flower is warmer than another, a bee can save some of its fuel by basking on that flower while it’s doing its pollinating business. And it turns out that bumble bees consistently do choose warmer flowers over cooler ones, even when the two flowers offer up the same quantity and quality of nectar. Some plants seem to be evolutionarily adapted to be slightly warmer because the warmer ones get visited more by the chilly bees.

Electricity is an energy carrier that efficiently delivers the energy found in primary sources to end-users, who in turn convert it into energy services. Electricity can be created in three main ways. The most common is through electromagnetic conversion, where electricity is generated by moving an electric conductor, like wires, inside a magnetic field. The most practical example of this is a generator connected to a turbine. The turbine provides the motion required to move the conductor in the generator. This energy for motion can come from various technologies. For example, wind turbines, hydro, or the steam created from heat produced a nuclear fission or coal combustion. Electricity can also be created through a chemical reaction. An example of this is a battery or fuel cell. Finally, electricity can be created through solid-state conversion, where electricity is generated using the structure and properties of a solid. A specially constructed solid consists of different molecules packed closely together to create an electric current when stimulated. An example of a technology that utilizes solid-state conversion is a solar PV cell. It is important to note that electricity is the same regardless of how it is produced.

    "question": "In the past fifty years, hundreds of millions of Americans have gotten the flu shot. If you’re one of them, you might have experienced a pretty common side effect: a sore arm. Is this merely the result of getting a metal needle jabbed into your muscle? Nope. When you get a shot, your body starts working overtime in order to keep you healthy. A flu shot works by tricking your immune system into thinking a live flu virus has invaded your body. Really, the virus is inactivated, which means it’s dead and can no longer infect you. But your body doesn’t know that. To your body, the flu shot is full of dangerous “antigens,” foreign substances that create an immunologic response. And an “immunologic response” is when your immune system activates white blood cells to respond to an invader. So once the vaccine deposits the antigens, your immune system jumps into action. It swarms the injection site. Some white blood cells produce antibodies, who attack the antigen and latch on to it. Other cells whisk antigens away to different parts of your body; and still others call for reinforcements. All this activity means inflammation, and enough inflammation causes pain, as well as the occasional fever or swelling, if you’re particularly unlucky. The good news, however, is that a little soreness means that the vaccine is doing its job. Consider the flu shot as a practice run for your immune system: by learning to respond to the harmless lookalike antigen of the vaccine, your body prepares itself to respond to the actual virus.",

    "question": "When something angers us, humans have rapid cognitions that motivate us to improve our mood. But anger itself can inhibit our ability to reach equilibrium: we see this in how angry people ruminate on how bad they feel, or how they try to vent their anger and end up prompting aggression. So, there must be better ways to regulate emotion aside from ruminating and venting that help keep aggression at bay. And it turns out, that has a lot to do with how much a person is aware of and able to classify their emotions. This is called emotion differentiation. For example, if people lack the capacity to describe and classify what they are feeling at a given time, they will find it difficult to discern more detail about their emotions beyond the fact that they feel “bad.” Low emotion differentiators are more distracted and less engaged during times of stress, and also less capable of thinking carefully about their options for how to behave under stress. High emotion differentiators spend less time on counterproductive practices, such as ruminating and venting. When people are better at differentiating their negative emotions, they have better emotional control, which means they have more ways of dealing with anger. So, they’re less likely to turn to aggression in the first place. Feeling angry is a part of life. But being aware of what kind of negativity you’re feeling can help you control it and get over it.",

    "question": "Frogs are a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura. The oldest fossil proto frog appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is found in tropical rain forests. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semipermeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in they are breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one-third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.

Communities everywhere are experiencing the harmful effects of climate change and more frequent extreme weather events. The science is clear — to stay on a path to net zero, we need an urgent global response. That means rapidly reducing carbon pollution and deploying carbon dioxide removal at scale. Carbon Dioxide Removal, or CDR, can help address emissions from the hardest to decarbonize sectors and eventually remove the legacy emissions already warming our planet and affecting our health. CDR includes technological approaches like Direct Air Capture with Durable Storage: Separating CO2 from ambient air and then storing the CO2 deep underground in geological reservoirs or in products like concrete. CDR can also be achieved through nature-based approaches like Soil Carbon Sequestration. This involves managing land so that soils absorb and hold more carbon. Minimizing soil tilling is one way to do this, or planting carbon sequestering cover crops between harvests. But as an emerging field, CDR approaches still require significant research, development, and demonstration to ensure CO2 removal can be deployed responsibly, effectively, and affordably to meet national and global net zero goals in the coming decades.",

    "question": "The water we use today has been around for a long long time. That is because water can recycle itself in the water cycle, which is also called the hydrologic cycle. Let's start the cycle with the evaporation of water from the surface of the ocean. As this moist air is lifted, it cools and water vapour condenses. It may form clouds. In fact, clouds are made up of tiny water droplets and ice crystals that are so small they can float in the air. This moisture in the atmosphere may be transported around the globe until it returns to the surface as precipitation. Precipitation may take the form of rain, snow, sleet or hell. Now once this water reaches the ground, one or two processes may occur. Some of the water may evaporate back into the atmosphere, or the water may penetrate the surface and become groundwater. The groundwater may take several different paths. The groundwater may seep in its way into the oceans river or streams, or it may go into an aquifer, which is a body of saturated walk rock through which water can easily move, or it may be released back into the atmosphere through transpiration. Transpiration occurs when leaves from trees and other vegetation give off water vapour through pores in their leaves. Some water on the Earth's surface is not absorbed by plants or become ground water, and it becomes surface runoff. This runoff may empty into lakes, rivers, and streams and then is carried back to the ocean where the cycle may begin.",

Coffee has less than five calories. – Caffeine seemed to be in violation of the laws of thermodynamics. Essentially, caffeine borrows energy from your future and gives it to you in the present. Caffeine occupies a receptor that normally is occupied by a chemical called adenosine, and this is the chemical that, over the course of the day, builds up and makes you feel tired and prepares the brain for sleep. Caffeine gets in there and blocks that receptor so you never feel that tiredness. – Right, and that’s the catch.

    "question": "If you’re near a railyard in uncommonly cold temps, though, you may notice tracks pulling apart from one another, or bolts shearing off from joints. The shock of unusual cold can majorly stress the steel tracks. These would have been laid at what’s called the “neutral temperature,” which represents a middle temperature of the surrounding environment. So, if the tracks were laid at seventy degrees, they can withstand both hot summer days and frigid winter nights. The problem comes with extreme weather. When the temps dip — say, to thirty below zero Fahrenheit — the steel contracts enough that it can pull apart at the joints. Switches, too, risk getting frozen in place or jammed from snowfall. Luckily, railroad engineers have a tried-and-true method for avoiding railway damage, and it’s the same method you employ to stay warm: they light a fire. Railroads place gas-fed heaters at various spots along the railway, often at switch points. When a cold snap hits, workers manually light the heaters, which steadily burn beside the tracks. The steel tracks don’t ignite, and trains have steel wheels that won’t catch fire as they roll down the railways. The sight may look like something from the gates of hell, but the small blazes are carefully managed. While other heating systems exist — running an electric current through the rails, or using hot-air blowers — they can be costly or impractical. An open flame can keep you, and the railroads, cozy.",

    "question": "The years 1781 Los Angeles is established and named Pablo de la Renta de los Angeles by forty four families from Mexico as a fort for soldiers. More than sixty five years later, the discovery of gold and silver metal draws settlers from across the country to northern California. After the rush for gold dies down, Americans had flocked to Northern California for a fortune begin to disperse and settle parts of Southern California. By 1870, the small towns of Los Angeles have gained more than five thousand six hundred residents, which multiplies nearly 20 times by the turn of the century. The rapidly increasing population puts additional strain on the Los Angeles River, the city's main source of water, which has not been helped by a recent two years of drought. In order to avoid tragedy, a new water source has to be found. The city of Los Angeles is a development as an urban center and growing thirst for water facilitated the triumph of the creation of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, but simultaneously led to the tragedies of the St. Francis Dam and the draining of important landmarks like Mono Lake and Owen zone. The year 1900, the city of Los Angeles is growing faster than its water resources, a need for the city is as clear as the water they need. In 1902, Irish American civil engineer William Holland was named superintendent of the Los Angeles Water Department. Soon after the department began considering options to quench the city of Los Angeles's growing thirst, they eventually settled on a lake in the vastly agricultural Owens Valley. The Owens Lake was more than enough to support its inhabitants, as it was once up to 12 miles long and eight miles wide. These two factors made Owens Valley the perfect candidate to supply Los Angeles with the water it needed to expand.",

A team of scientists from the British Antarctic Survey and University of Hamburg have published the first comprehensive inventory of sea-and-land animals, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in and around the South Orkney Islands. The inventory, published in the Journal of Bio-geography, concluded there are more than 1200 known marine- and- land species in the area. Scientists claim this is more species than are found in the Galapagos Islands, contradicting the long-held notion that waters around the poles have less biodiversity than those in more tropical and temperate climates. The documented species include five that are new to science. The team spent 7 weeks aboard the RRS James Clark Ross in 2006, trawling and diving in the icy waters, where they say they observed more than 800 species living on the seabed. The scientists claim the islands have little evidence of invasive species. And that the biodiversity has remained nearly unchanged in the 100 years the islands have been studied.

Up to now, life has evolved, and now we actually have the ability and the power to engineer it, to design it. And so I'm curious about what the natural world is going to look like in the future. So synthetic biology is sort of the next level of genetic engineering. So about 40 years ago, we being scientists and engineers, developed techniques to basically move pieces of DNA from one organism to another. And this was sort of done by physically cutting and pasting. Now we're moving beyond that where we can write DNA so we're no longer limited to the pieces. We can cut from one and put in another. We can chemically synthesize this DNA on a machine and put that into an organism. And now we can even create new organisms completely from scratch. So if you imagine a cell that's programed to make a useful compound, say, material or drug, then what you have is basically a micro-scale manufacturing unit. It's basically a cellular factory. And the cool thing about cellular factory is that when you want more factories, you love that cell grow and divide. So in in the lab, if we have one bacteria, we put it in a flask.

The tobacco industry, however, are against this and they in particular argue that the cigarette box is not a form of advertising. Michaela has been doing her PhD looking at cigarette advertising and how it's changed over the last 50 years. Basically, I've accessed advertising from the tobacco industry since the 1950s and just analyze the images and looked at the use of the cigarette box within the adverts. In the very early adverts, the cigarette box is a very small part of the adverts and they focus much more on the social aspects of smoking. However, as you move through the decades and get closer to the present day, the cigarette box became more and more of a focal point in the adverts. My argument is that the cigarette box has actually become iconic to each brand. So when a smoker takes a box out of their pocket, they are actually advertising that brand. So what we hope will come out of this is that the government will introduce plain packaging. And like Australia who have already introduced its policy and Ireland who are again beginning to introduce its policy, we hope that the UK will stop cigarette companies from using their box as a form of advertising.",

The researchers say when ants find something too large to be lifted and carried forward they drag it backwards. So the researchers put the ants reversing navigation skills to the test. They painted a white grid onto the desert floor and released an ant with a large food crumb and it began its backward trek towards its home. During normal forward homing the ant goes straight to its fictive home indicated with the red dot. During backward homing ants frequently interrupted reading and performed foodless search loops probably to gain further orientation cues.

    "question": "Let us delve into the profound impact of urbanization on our planet's geographical landscape. As cities expand, they dramatically alter the natural environment, creating both challenges and opportunities. One of the most evident impacts of urbanization is the loss of natural habitats. The expansion of cities often leads to deforestation and the destruction of ecosystems. For instance, in many developing countries, urban sprawl has led to the loss of critical wildlife habitats and biodiversity. This not only affects the flora and fauna but also disrupts ecological balance, leading to long-term environmental consequences. However, urbanization also brings the opportunity for sustainable development. Modern cities, with their concentrated population, can potentially reduce the per capita environmental impact. Urban areas are ideal for implementing green infrastructure, like vertical gardens and efficient public transport systems, which can mitigate some of the negative effects of urban sprawl. The challenge lies in planning and developing cities in a way that balances growth with environmental sustainability. This requires innovative urban planning that integrates green spaces, promotes efficient resource use, and fosters a harmonious relationship between urban development and the natural world.\"",

    "question": "So some scientists wondered how much these chemosignals might play a role in emotional contagion among humans. In a 2012 study, one team of researchers designed an experiment to find out. In it, one set of participants watched videos that would provoke either fear or disgust, while wearing sweat pads in their armpits. Afterward, a second set of participants were asked to smell those sweat pads, and the experimenters recorded their emotional state. Conveniently, the emotions of fear and disgust tend to provoke opposite physical responses. When you’re scared, your body will typically try to take in more sensory information. So your face will open up as you breathe more deeply and scan the environment with your eyes. On the other hand, when you’re disgusted, you’ll generally reject sensory information. Like, you’ll walk past a row of portapotties and you’ll scrunch up your face, take really shallow breaths, and look around less. Now, these reactions aren’t always super visible to the eye, but by monitoring their eyes and facial movements, the researchers could tell which facial muscles were activated in each person, and which emotional state their expressions reflected. And the authors found that participants who sniffed disgust sweat tended to display disgust which, you know, seems like a normal reaction when you’re sniffing sweat pads, but also, those who sniffed fear sweat would also display fear.",

Globalization can usefully be conceived as a process (or set of processes), which embodies a transformation in the spatial organization of social relations, and transactions, generating transcontinental or interregional flows and networks of activity, interaction and power. It is characterized by four types of change:First, it involves a stretching of social, political and economic activities across political frontiers, regions and continents. Second, it suggests the intensification, or the growing magnitude, of interconnectedness and flows of trade, investment, finance, migration, culture, etc. Third, the growing extensity and intensity of global interconnectedness can be linked to a speeding up of global interactions and processes, as the evolution of world-wide systems of transport and communication increases the velocity of the diffusion of ideas, goods, information, capital, and people. -Fourth, the growing extensity, intensity and velocity of global interactions can be associated with their deepening impact such that the effects of distant events can be highly significant elsewhere and even the most local developments may come to have enormous global consequences. In this sense, the boundaries between domestic matters and global affairs can become increasingly blurred.Globalization has three definitions. There are more trade transactions, communications, services and multinational companies across the border. There are more travels and cooperation between different countries.

    "question": "When you are facing a complex problem or trying to do something bold, start with a smaller version of the larger problem. You might have to break it into several manageable minor problems to solve one at a time, and then put them together. Focus exclusively on that small problem and solve it. Use the answers to this small issue to expand your knowledge of the larger issue. Repeat. If you take a look around, you can see this pattern playing out everywhere. Some examples are given. When you watch the world, you have to look at the relations within the world. When you understand the world, a few things are in relation to each other. When you study different disciplines, they are related to one another. For example, if we study a family, culture, religion and politics need to be concerned.

And it's possible to express all forms of power consumption using this unit of the light bulb. I started measuring everything around my house, around my office. And I found some surprising things. First, I plug in a phone charger. And it didn't even register on this power meter. It uses one hundredth of a light bulb of power. So I don't think the phone chargers can be our NO. 1 phone energy consumption. Just taking one hot bath everyday uses the same energy, same power of five light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. And I found I've been steadily using 40 light bulbs worth of gas for heating, making hot air or hot water. And that surprises me. Transport is one of the biggest forms of energy consumption, and it uses about a third about our energy. If you drive an average car 50 kilometers a day, that corresponds to adding 40 light bulbs on all the time. Today, the average British person is using 125 light bulbs of power.

So language acquisition starts earlier than most people think. And it also ends later than most people think. When does child language acquisition stop? Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is no obvious endpoint for learning sounds, of course, there is for learning grammar, there is for vocabulary, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English. Most of us only have a vocabulary of 50, 60, 70 thousand words, whatever it is until there is always something to learn.

    "question": "There comes a time in a desert ant's life when a piece of food is too large to ignore, but too heavy to lift, and the only way to get it home is to adopt a new style of walking. The long-legged and speedy Cataglyphis fortis normally covers ground with a three-legged stride that moves two legs forwards on one side, and one on the other. For the next step, the insect mirrors the move with its other three legs. But recordings of ants in the Tunisian desert reveal that when faced with oversized lumps of food 10 times their own weight, the forward 'tripod' walking style is abandoned. Unable to lift the morsels in their mandibles, the ants drag the food backwards instead, moving all six legs independently. 'This is the first time we have seen this in any ants,' said lead author Sarah Pfeffer at the University of Ulm in Germany. The ants' long legs already help keep their bodies away from the scorching desert floor and enable them to speed around at up to 60cm per second. 'Think of Usain Bolt, who has very long legs compared to body size. The desert floor is also very hot, so the further away their bodies are from the surface, the better,' said co-author Matthias Wittlinger. The ants have also evolved to function at body temperatures of 50 degree Celsius in a desert where temperatures can soar to 70 degree Celsius. 'They’re basically just trying to get out of the heat,' he added.",

Most start using the internet at the average age of three – and as recent research shows, children now spend more time playing and socializing online than watching television programs. Given this change in habits, it is not surprising that a recent House of Lords report has raised online safety and behavior as an important issue. The report said that for children, learning to survive in a world dominated by the internet should be as important as reading and writing. The House of Lords Communications Committee also warned that children should not be leaving school without 'a well-rounded understanding of the digital world'. It also suggested that the government should think about implementing new legal requirements and a code of conduct companies would have to adhere to, which would help to bring the internet up to 'child-friendly standards'. Of course, trying to rectify this lack of child-centered design is not an easy task, but one that requires the cooperation and goodwill of many sectors. It will need to involve consultation with technology, education, legal and policy experts. And it would also be a good idea to make children and young people part of the process.",

    "question": "Not long ago, some of you may have read about a team of mountain-climbing scientists who helped to recalculate the elevation of the highest mountain in the world: Mt. Everest. Of course, the elevation of Mt. Everest was determined many years ago, using traditional surveying methods. But these scientists wanted to make a more precise measurement using a new method that takes advantage of recent advances in technology. It's called the Global Positioning System. The Global Positioning System uses 24 satellites that circle the Earth. Each of these satellites is constantly sending out signals. And each signal contains important information that can be used to determine the longitude, latitude, and elevation of any point on the Earth's surface. Well, in order to use this system to calculate Mt. Everest's elevation, scientists needed to put a special receiver on its summit to receive signals from the satellites. The problem with this was that, in the past, the receivers were much too heavy for climbers to carry. But now these receivers have been reduced to about the size and weight of a handheld telephone, so climbers were able to take a receiver to the top of Everest and, from there, to access the satellite system signals that would allow them to determine the precise elevation. And it turns out that the famous peak is actually a few feet higher than was previously thought.",

Mallon then went to work for a lawyer; she left after seven of the eight people in that household became ill. In 1906, she took a position in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and within two weeks 10 of the 11 family members were hospitalized with typhoid. She changed jobs again, and similar occurrences happened in three more households. She worked as a cook for the family of a wealthy New York banker, Charles Henry Warren.

For many centuries, sailors used to place their clothing in a cloth bag, tie the bag to a rope and throw it overboard, letting the ship drag it for hours. The principle was simple: force water through the clothes to remove the dirt. But in the household before running water and electricity, washing clothes took a staggering amount of labor. To wash, boil and rinse a single load of clothes could take 50 gallons of water, which had to be hand carried from a pump or well. Hand-wringing, rubbing and lifting the clothes could expose women to caustic substances in the soaps. The whole process for a household's laundry could take an entire day or more of backbreaking labor. In 1846, a patented washing machine imitated the human hand moving cloth over a washboard, by using a lever to rub the clothes between two rib surfaces. This machine was sold in the U.S. as late as 1927. The first electric clothes washers, in which a motor rotated the tub, were introduced into America about 1900.",

    "question": "People choke for many reasons. Choking under pressure is more than a flub; choking happens when a person experiences a dramatic drop in his or her normal skill when under pressure. Choking results from a psychological event. Any situation that involves high pressure to succeed can cause choking. Whether you’re giving the toast at a wedding or kicking that game-winning field goal, the importance of the event and the prospect of being judged by others can cause choking. Research shows that when activities require thinking, we’re more prone to choke. And when we see familiar faces, our self-conscious pressure builds, making it even harder to think and perform. So, what can people do to ward off psychological choking hazards? First, practice putting yourself in realistic, stressful practice situations, where you exercise hyper-attention to detail, such as when students take practice exams. Second, control your focus— if you’re singing an aria, put less attention on the step-by-step maneuvers of the performance and more on how your song fills the room.

There is a time when I think companies have many of the adventures in the world. That involves the companies' world. It was the bosses' world. Now I think it reverses the case. We have a shortage in talent base within countries and between countries, have an intense battle between companies to hire the most talented workers and also between countries, which are looking to recruit talented young people, talented young immigrants. We have this sense of immigrants being things that countries are battled to keep out, and immigrants want to get in, climb of the walls. I think the opposite isn't that the case. And the topic is that countries are trying to lure bright young people to get them to go to universities and get them to become immigrants. So, on many levels, talent is a premium. There is a shortage of talent, and so countries, companies, all sorts of organizations, of course, volunteer organizations as well as, are competing to hire the best and the brightest. You know we have a baby-boom population which is aging. We have an economy which is becoming more sophisticated. And so, for all those sorts of reasons, talent is a premium.",

    "question": "The question today of what makes a luxury brand, a luxury brand and how do we distinguish it, is very hard to answer. The standard business response is to say they are more exclusive. And we get exclusivity by having high price and relatively small amounts of the product available. The reality, however, of luxury brands is that they are sold in their millions, and in some cases, are not priced that much higher than the standard output. The only way I can really answer your question is to say, it is all relative. As you said in your introduction, it wasn't that long ago in Australia that we would have considered two televisions to be a luxury, or even further back, one colour television. And you can make a strong argument, for example, that Starbucks in China, right now, is a luxury purchase because of its cost, because of how frequently it is purchased by many people. So, I think the long answer is a complicated one, but the answer is, it depends who you talk to. I think in the business community what we would say, is that there is a small cluster of more expensive brands which have a distinct strategy that we would identify as being luxury brands. And they start with the Rolls Royce and the Tiffanys and the Louis Vuittons of the world. And, I think that tends to be how we see them.",

    "question": "The main problem we have isn’t an issue of actually doing the work. It’s just starting. Starting is the hardest part. So how do we make it easier? Take your large task and break it into something small. Once you think you’ve made it small, make it even smaller than that. Do the same with your time commitment. It’s great that you blocked out the next three hours to do work, but guess what, studying for three hours is incredibly daunting. You do not want to do that. You want to watch Med School Insiders YouTube videos instead. Here’s how you get past that – you’re not studying for three hours anymore. Instead, you’re studying for only 25 minutes, which is a lot easier than 3 hours. After those 25 minutes are done, you’re getting a break, guaranteed. Seems simple enough. This is the Pomodoro technique in action, and it is one of my favorite study hacks. Early on in the day, I generally like to knock out the difficult tasks first, since it makes the rest of the day a breeze. But I don’t always get the luxury of doing that. There are instances where starting is so difficult, that there’s no way I would be able to tackle the most daunting task first. In those instances, I start with something easy. That can be something as simple as doing my laundry or washing dishes.

It's a common misconception that translators and interpreters do the same thing. So I just like to highlight a few similarities and differences between the two. Firstly, translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. So, for example, a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved, but will translate the written evidence used in the case. Secondly, both jobs require different skills. I translate to require the ability to write well and comprehensively into a target language. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their native language. For example, although I can speak French to a good standard. I cannot translate from English to French although I could translate from French to English, which means I'm only halfway there to being an international player. An interpreter needs to be able to speak both languages proficiently. Thirdly, the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ.

The only emissions that they produce are indirect, meaning those that result from manufacturing parts, installation, operation, and maintenance. But even those are minimal. Second, renewable energy can decrease pollution, and therefore reduce threats to our health. Wind, solar, and hydroelectric systems create no air pollution emissions, and geothermal and biomass energy systems emissions are much lower than non-renewable energy sources. Third, renewable energy is a reliable source of power. Because renewable energy sources are, well, renewable, they will never run out. Once built, renewable facilities cost very little to operate, and the fuel is often free as a result renewable energy prices tend to be stable over time. While renewable energy has many advantages, it is not without downsides. It is difficult for renewable energy sources to generate power on the same large scale as fossil fuels. Building wind farms and dams can disrupt wildlife and migration patterns and lead to ecological destruction. Both solar and wind energy are intermittent.

London, of course, where one unnamed pub was charging a whopping £8.06 on average. But London is far from the priciest place to buy a beer. It’s the seventh most expensive capital, according to one beer index, which analyzed the price of brew from local supermarkets and hotel lobbies. Tokyo, Bern, Paris, Beijing, Amman and Doha top the list of most expensive places to buy beer, with a pint costing nearly $20 in Qatar’s capital. Why? The short answer is inflation.

It's 1 million times bigger than the earth, and without it our planet would be a dark, cold rock floating in space. You guessed it. The incredible brilliant Sun. The earth gets more energy from this ball of fire and gas in one day than the whole world's population uses in an entire year. Every living thing depends on the Sun for its existence, from tiny microbes deep in the ocean, to plants, animals, and people. Humans have been tinkering with solar energy since the dawn of time. Ancient civilizations use glass and mirrors to light fires, but it wasn't until the 1950s that technology was developed to convert the sun's energy into electricity using photovoltaic cells. Today solar technology is more efficient and less expensive, and is used all around the globe to create electricity, heat water, cook food, and even power vehicles. So how does solar panels usually work? When the Sun hits a solar panel, material inside, usually silicon, absorbs the energy. This causes the electrons and it's atoms to get very excited and start dancing around. The atoms then get hot and shed the electrons, which travel out of the panel through copper wiring and ZAP we have electricity. A control device, called an inverter, changes this electricity from direct current to the alternating current we use. The electricity then passes from breaker boxes to outlets and into electrical items, like your computer and lights. Whatever you don't use can go back into the grid to be used by someone else. So there you have it - the amazing power of the Sun.",

Let's take a step back for a moment to provide a larger framework that helps you understand the idea of semantic noise a bit easier. Communication is the process of transmitting information from one person to another. Information is a pattern of data organized in a particular way. For example, a sentence consists of symbols that form words in a particular language with a particular meaning. The sentence also utilizes grammar, which is a recognized way to structure words forming a sentence. Noise is any type of disturbance that interferes with the interpretation of the information. Some argue that noise exists in all communication. Semantic noise doesn't involve sound but rather ambiguity in words, sentences or other symbols used in communication. The ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same words, phrases or sentences. The differences in interpretation can be quite small, even undetectable, in regular communication between people from the same culture, age, education and experience, or drastically different because of such things as culture, age or experience.",

The most important thing is you have to trust your people to do work themselves and if you’re in the business of overseeing every single decision they make you’re not gonna be a very effective manager because you’ll be stretched too thin and you’ll certainly never be able to rise to higher levels of Management where you’re overseeing dozens or hundreds or even thousands of people, so that’s the first thing. The second is work hard to understand what the people underneath you do. They have this… there’s this tendency to think you know. If I came up through one skill as I oversee people with different skills. I’m just gonna trust them to get it right and you have to. Of course you’re not gonna be able to understand what everybody on your team does all day but if you can understand their motivations, their terminology, their way of communicating. You’re gonna be a lot better as a manager. And finally, this is a kind of simple thing, but have as many one-on-one meetings as you possibly can. I think one thing that there’s a lot of evidence is that having one-on-one meetings especially with your direct reports is one of the strongest predictors of success as a manager.

    "question": "The term core competence gets thrown around a lot, but it has a specific meaning, one that’s especially important for strategists and companies with multiple business units or product lines. CK Prahalad and Gary Hamel, who introduced the concept, described the diversified corporation as a large tree. The core products are the trunk and major limbs. The business units are smaller branches, and the end products are the leaves. The core competence is the root system that provides nourishment and stability. It’s essentially what your organization knows about coordinating production and technology. If you only compare end products, you’ll miss the real strength of your company. To figure that out, start by identifying specific core competencies, the five or six things at most that your company does better than anyone else. These meet three requirements. First, they provide access to a wide variety of markets. Consider what Honda knows about engines. It gives them a distinctive advantage in cars, lawnmowers and generators. Second, core competencies contribute to the benefits of the product as perceived by the customer. Clearly Honda’s expertise in engines fits the bill here too.

That is there are a lot of canned foods were being - coming onto the market at the time. And also, refrigerators were really becoming very, very popular during the Great Depression, both in cities and in rural parts of the country. Thanks to electrification, the Rural Electrification Administration, people could buy appliances. You know, farmers could buy appliances. And that meant frozen foods were becoming big. And, you know, at that time, few people could afford to buy them during the early years of the Great Depression. But, you know, gradually, these things picked up. And so this was, like, the sort of beginning of the era when people were starting to think about supermarkets with rows and rows of freezer cases and rows and rows of canned foods.",

It was fixed and unchangeable and things happen on it, just as people walk around. So the stars, the comets, and the planets, and the other heavenly bodies moved around and traced down their parts on this completely unchanging stage of space. In the 20th century, as the result of Einstein’s work, that view of the universe was completely transformed. We began to understand that there was no absolutely fixed stage of space at all on which all celestial notions were played out. But in some sense on the larger scale in the universe, the space itself was in this state of a continuous dynamic change.

Wisdom teeth emerge when a person’s dental arch becomes large enough to hold more teeth. Some people never develop a large enough space in their mouths. Others only get one wisdom tooth.

A black hole is a region in space where the force of gravity is so strong, not even light, the fastest known entity in our universe, can escape.

Scientists have theorized several different types of black holes, with stellar and supermassive black holes being the most common. Stellar black holes form when massive stars die and collapse. They're roughly 10 to 20 times the mass of our sun, and scattered throughout the universe. There could be millions of these stellar black holes in the Milky Way alone.

It saves forests, cuts emissions, and means less pollution. Sadly it’s not that simple. Recycling is deeply entwined with our economic system, and right now doesn’t make much economic sense. It often costs more to recycle than it does to just throw things away, which is bad news for the environment. So is it worth paying for? Recycling saves serious amounts of energy, which in turn means lower greenhouse gas emissions. Making cans from recycled aluminium uses 95% less energy than mining and using raw materials. Recycling steel saves 60%, as does recycling paper. So it boils down to how quickly we’re able to remake the way we make things. As of 2018, we were on track to generate waste at more than double the rate of population growth through 2050, so we can expect plenty more rubbish to pile up. Some communities are running out of room to store all their trash and have stopped collecting plastic, paper and glass. Others are just sending material to landfills or burning it.

    "question": "If you put extended pressure on your arm, by leaning or sleeping on it, it might go numb and then give you a tingling feeling. Your arm falls asleep like this because prolonged pressure on a nerve, or on a nerve's blood supply, can temporarily damage it. Nerves allow you to sense feeling by sending messages to the brain describing sensory input. If you touch a hot burner, you pull your hand back because the nerves in your hand have sent the message to your brain that your hand is in pain. When a nerve is compressed or when the blood supply to a nerve is compromised, the normal messages nerves send to the brain are stopped or altered. At this point, when the nerve is no longer functioning appropriately, numbness occurs. When the nerve begins to recover, you may feel a tingling sensation. This feeling of pins and needles is due to the fact that at the early stages of the nerves' recovery, it functions inappropriately, giving your brain misinformation. To understand why nerves work this way, we need to think about the anatomy of a nerve. Each nerve is filled with thousands of nerve fibers, each carrying specific information to the brain. Some of these fibers are large, others are small, and all recover at different rates. Because the thousands of fibers that make up a damaged nerve recover at different speeds, the message they collectively send the brain as they are recovering is inaccurate. So though your arm isn't actually tingling at all, the way it would if you received a mild electric shock, your brain believes that it's tingling because the brain always believes messages that nerves send–whether those messages are accurate or not.",

It last so long, and if you write a bad book or do a bad play, you know, I will be shocked when it be showed and then no one would suffer. A bad building has a serious impact for, could be hundreds of years on the people around it. And suppose the book arose a little bit from the frustration, almost anger than there is so much bad architecture around. And then I realize if you talk about architecture, you will say why building are not more beautiful. Then you will say I can use such word as \"beauty\", that's a really arrogant word. And no one knows what beautiful is. It's all in the eye of beholder. I couldn't help but think that actually. Well, you know that we all attempt to agree that Rome is nice than Milkykings, and San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt, so we can make that sort of generalization, surely they are something we can say about why a building work or why it doesn't.

    "question": "Sustainable tourism is a vital concept in the modern travel industry. As we explore new places and cultures, it's crucial to consider the impact our travel has on the environment, local communities, and economies. Sustainable tourism is about more than just reducing carbon footprints. It's about preserving the natural and cultural heritage of the destinations we visit. For instance, eco-tourism initiatives, which focus on conservation and supporting local communities, are becoming increasingly popular. These initiatives not only protect natural habitats but also provide economic benefits to local residents. However, the challenge of sustainable tourism goes beyond individual actions. It requires collaboration between governments, tourism operators, and travelers. For example, creating policies that limit the environmental impact of tourism, promoting local businesses, and educating tourists on responsible travel practices are essential steps. In a world facing environmental challenges and cultural homogenization, sustainable tourism offers a path to enjoy the world's beauty while protecting it for future generations.

We all know what we ourselves mean by a novel and have our favorite novelists, whether they are from the heyday of Victorian fiction - Dickens, say, or George Eliot - or someone more modern or postmodern, for example, B. S. Johnson, who is famed for writing a novel that was bought in a box, with loose pages that you could read in any order. Again, you might be a fan of crime or detective fiction, which brings the added complication of genre. That is, does the fact that a work of fiction is comedy, tragedy, satire, ghost story, and so on, affect our definition? Anyway, as far as the history of the English novel is concerned, we're on fairly solid ground when we date the first novels to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The first that is still read as a novel in the way we read novels now is Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, which did have an enormous effect on English prose writing, but for me it would be Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Now, people have tried to locate the beginnings even earlier than this, to Elizabethan prose writing and even further back, but I think this is to lose sight of what a novel is and does and confuses any kind of fiction with the true novel.",

There are still problems in teaching this subject due to lack of commitment and lack of teachers to teach. Criticism about the theory of citizenship education is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflected democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say over decision making. It suggests that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instil in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact. Citizenship education is one critical element, and students will acquire knowledge of civics, including the principles of democracy and associated local, state and Australian government structure and processes. In addition, students will also learn to participate responsibly and cooperatively in community. Citizenship curriculum is very important for students, but it is neglected by many schools. There are only 1/5 schools introduced this class to campus and allocated less time than other subjects.

    "question": "Dogs are noted for their extreme friendliness towards humans. They crave human company and gaze intently at their human companions. The partnership between dogs and humans stretches back tens of thousands of years into prehistoric times. It has worked out surprisingly well for dogs, who, with human backing, have become Earth’s most abundant land carnivore. Dogs evolved from wolves through a process of domestication by humans. Even when they are hand-raised by humans, modern wolves seldom show the degree of devotion to humans that dogs do. This has led scientists to suspect that the hypersociality of dogs towards humans is more than just a learned trait, and has to do with evolved genetic differences between dogs and wolves. In 2022 a team of American geneticists published findings identifying genetic differences between dogs and wolves that may be responsible for the special canine attachment to humans. On chromosome number six of the dog genome, the researchers identified several genes associated with dog hypersociality. Interestingly, these genes correspond to parts of the human genome that also are involved in social behavior. Specifically, mutations in the corresponding part of the human genome can lead to a rare condition called Williams-Beuren syndrome. People with this syndrome have hypersocial behavior like that of dogs, along with certain cognitive deficits. Researchers have found evidence that dogs may have cognitive deficits like those of people with this syndrome. The findings might tell us about far more than just how social devotion to humans evolved in dogs. Given the genetic similarities, they may tell us much about how social behavior evolved in humans.",

I want to talk about what I do as a curator and then from that also talk a bit about the kinds of history that I think museums are particularly good at creating and communicating. I think this is something I would really like to discuss because it is not necessarily very well understood is that I think museums, as Dave insisted by putting up my quote in his slide, create a very particular kind of history. It’s not the kind of history that gets created in books or in dating films or in compositions, it’s a very particular kind of history that grows out of the fact that museums are centrally interested and defined by their collections. I should say that is not an uncontested view of museums but it is certainly my view of museums.  Curators try to understand material culture as an evidence of other people’s lives as a means to try to understand other people - what they look like, what they did, how they made a living, what they hoped for in their lives, how they tried to construct their world and why they made particular choices. One way in which curators differ from other historians is therefore in terms of how we interrogate the past, what elements we use to communicate the past. Most academic historians are trained very much in the discipline of words and they concentrate on words still today, although it is changing a little bit. If you go through university history primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like archival accounts, manuscripts and now oral histories, and most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books.  There are also other kinds of historians. Obviously, filmmakers and photographers concentrate on creating images of the world and arranging them in meaningful sequences, but curators attend to objects.

    "question": "We appear to take it as a rule, or as a law of nature, that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home. For example, species from the Arctic, or even a temperate region, could not survive in a tropical climate, nor could a tropical species last long if it found itself at the South Pole. But it is true to say there’s too much emphasis placed on the degree of adaptation of species to the climates where they live. We assume that this adaptation – if all species are descended from a single form – must have taken place over millions of years, yet a large number of plants and animals brought from different countries remain perfectly healthy in their new home. Also, there are several examples of animal species that have extended their range, within historical times, from warmer to cooler latitudes and the other way round. Rats and mice provide good examples: they have been transported by man to many parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, and they can be found living in the cold climate of the Faroe Islands to the north through the tropical zones to the Falklands in the south. It is possible to see adaptation to any climate as a quality that is part of an inborn flexibility of the physical and mental constitution of most animals. Therefore, the ability to survive in the most different climates by both man and his domestic animals, and the fact that elephants once existed in an ice age while living species live in tropical areas, should not be seen as deviations from the rule, but as examples of this flexibility being brought into action under particular circumstances.",

    "question": "If you liked the colorful animals we just saw, you're going to love these next animals: frogs. You might not normally think of frogs as being colorful, but these frogs definitely are. They are the dart-poison frogs of Central and South America. Look at their striking colors, often yellow with black stripes or deep blue with black spots. Beyond being nice to look at, these markings have a purpose. They warn predators that these frogs are poisonous. When threatened, these frogs secrete a substance through their skin that would easily kill whatever animal might try to eat them. Their bright colors communicate this, and so most animals tend not to hunt them. Now, speaking of hunting, for centuries these frogs were sought after by hunters. As you might think, the hunters didn't want to eat the frogs, but rather, they captured them for their poison. They would add the poison to the tips of their hunting arrows. Of course, nowadays most hunters use guns. These days, dart-poison frogs are of less interest to hunters than to medical researchers. Researchers believe that they can make new heart medicine from the poison, because it acts as a stimulant on the body's nervous system. Researchers think they could use it to stimulate a weak heart. There is, however, a problem with doing research on these frogs. Those that are caught in the wild will produce their poison until they die. However, those that are born in captivity, like the ones you see here, will not produce any poison at all.",

So that kind of started this whole project.” Wang worked in Trey Ideker’s lab, where they study changing patterns of DNA methylation in humans. Small chemical entities, called methyl groups, attach to stretches of DNA, which affects what sequences are active. As we age, some stretches of DNA get more methylated, and others less.

    "question": "Millions of television viewers watching the surfing championships in South Africa witnessed a spectacle that seemed straight out of a horror film. While sitting on his surfboard, waiting to compete, surfer Nick Fanning was seemingly attacked by a great white shark on live television. Or was he? In plain sight, viewers saw the shark slowly emerge from the water and gnaw at his surfboard. Fanning naturally started flailing in the water to get away from the shark, but as rescuers rushed to the scene, the shark simply swam away. Further review of the footage suggests that perhaps the shark was not aggressive at all, and more likely just curious. Scientists now think that sharks use their teeth similarly to the way humans use their fingers or cats use their paws to poke or prod an unknown object. What is unclear to researchers is the nature of most shark encounters. Are the sharks being aggressive or just curious? Data shows that when a shark bites a human, it is more likely to swim away than continue the attack. Most shark “attacks”do not end in a fatality. Still, sharks are ferocious creatures and can be deadly. The most aggressive sharks are bull sharks and mako sharks, although attacks are incredibly rare. These sharks are thought to be aggressive because humans are roughly the same size as seals, one of their main prey in the water. Other sharks, such as the hammerhead shark or nurse shark, usually only attack when provoked. Still, other sharks, like the whale shark, a gentle giant, are no threat to humans.",

    "question": "How do you think the baby's heart rate compares to the parents’? Newborns have resting heart rates around 100 to 150 beats per minute, way higher than that of adults. In fact, a newborn's resting heart rate is in the ballpark of the target heart rate for an adult doing a heavy workout. What gives? Why do newborns’ hearts beat so much faster than adults’? Part of the answer lies in the fact that babies grow so dramatically. They burn food in every cell of their bodies to fuel that growth. The process requires not only an abundance of milk but also oxygen, and it produces large amounts of carbon dioxide as waste. Babies’ hearts work overtime to keep supplying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide to fuel their amazing growth. But growth isn’t the only factor, because it's not just baby animals we're talking about. Adult Chihuahuas have much higher heart rates than adult elephants. Why? Chihuahuas have a greater surface-to-volume ratio. In other words, the Chihuahua has a greater proportion of skin than internal tissue, which means it loses more heat to the environment, relatively speaking, than a larger animal. Babies’ hearts beat much faster than their parents’, both to fuel their growth and make up for greater heat loss to the environment. So little hearts maintain a higher metabolic rate, pound for pound, than big hearts.",

Scientists have not only found cancer in many other animals, they have found it in dinosaurs that lived more than sixty-five million years ago. Wondering if fossils could tell us something about ancient cancer, scientists traveling with a portable x-ray machine scanned ten-thousand dinosaur vertebrae of over seven-hundred museum specimens. These included many popular dinosaurs such as Stegosaurus, Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus. Much to their surprise, they found that only one group suffered from cancer -- the hadrosaurs, or “duck-billed” dinosaurs. Twenty-nine benign tumors were found in the tail bones of ninety-seven animals. These were mostly hemangiomas or tumors of the blood vessels. Doctors find the same type of tumors in humans today. One Edmontosaurus also had a malignant tumor. Why did duck-Billed dinosaurs have cancer and not the others? Scientists aren't sure. They thought that if hadrosaurs were long-lived, they would have a greater chance of developing cancer, but they lived relatively short lives. These twenty-five foot long herbivores needed plenty to eat, so diet was another thing scientists considered. Maybe conifers were to blame. Hadrosaurs ate plenty of them and they did contain known carcinogens. The trouble is, other conifer eaters didn't exhibit the same cancer.

What also helped Latin writing flourish was the nature of Roman education. Whatever its faults as they would appear to us, its linguistic and literary emphasis seemed designed to produce orators and writers.

    "question": "Why does burning a food item provide information about its value as a food? The nutritional value of food can be measured on many different scales. The most basic measurement scale is the free energy content of the food. In other words, how much energy is released when chemical bonds within the food are broken? The energy content of food is measured in calories, the amount of kinetic energy required to raise the temperature of one ml of water, one degree. Food is burned under controlled conditions, breaking chemical bonds and releasing free energy. The burning is chemically similar to the breakdown of food in cellular respiration although the process occurs much more quickly and in a less controlled fashion during ignition. Calorimeter can measure the energy in food, but can not measure the digested energy of what we have.",

Bicycling has gotten an additional boost by a very unfortunate event which is the COVID crisis. Many people found themselves at home and in the need for physical activity and they were flocking to bikes, often for recreational purposes. We have people who still go to work or have to make a trip but are not comfortable making it on a public transport anymore. And they are switching to the bicycle to make that trip. So, they are using the bike for a utilitarian trip purpose or as a substitute for public transport. Many European countries have had higher cycling levels historically as the United States, but even from those levels now, they have made efforts for putting in bike lanes, putting in cycle tracks, doing intersection modifications to accommodate bicyclists. They’ve seen a big growth in cycling.

    "question": "So let's just talk a little bit about a telescope. Our eye is the telescope we all are used to. It's a little tiny five millimeter telescope, and it serves us very well. But if we make telescopes bigger, we get a couple of good things. We have larger telescopes and they collect a lot more light so we can see things that are fainter. But it turns out they greatly improve detail. And that's because of the nature that light is a wave, and wave effects are what we call quantum mechanical effects, meaning that when you use a little telescope to look at waves, it becomes blurry through what we call diffraction. And so larger telescopes are extremely useful to improve detail. The other thing that telescopes allow us to do is to put modern digital detectors behind them. Our eye is about the same sensitivity as a photographic plate. A photographic plate can be sat there and it can look at the sky for an hour so it can see fainter. But modern digital detectors are almost 100 times more efficient than our eyes at collecting light. And so you can improve things by a factor of 100. That's like building a telescope ten times bigger. And so that improvement has been one of the things that's allowed astronomy to do so much in the optical regime in the last 30 years.",

Collective illusion is a situation where most people in a group go along with an idea that they don’t actually agree with, simply because they incorrectly believe that most people in the group agree with it. Why we're so afraid to deviate from our groups is an evolutionary holdover where it is in fact dangerous to be ostracized from the group. For as important as conformity is to us as human beings, it turns out we're actually not terribly good at estimating group consensus. Your brain assumes that the loudest voices repeated the most often are the majority. And so, we can get duped by a 'vocal fringe' into believing that that is the majority. And as soon as that happens, our conformity bias can be weaponized into leading us to adopt beliefs that the majority never actually held.

An experiment was conducted on the environment and climate in the 1930s when people first noticed climate change. Humans have been trying to change their lifestyles to deal with it, but the observation of climate change is difficult from area to area. A method is introduced to help understand the mechanism of the climate system. Researchers predict that temperatures will increase about two to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. What's less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet. Some climate models predict subtle changes. Others forecast rising sea levels, which could flood coastal areas around the world. Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent. Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas, and species unable to adapt to the changing conditions would face extinction, although much remains to be learned about global warming.

    "question": "To us, the environment in which fish dwell often seems cold, dark, and mysterious. But there are advantages to living in water, and they have played an important role in making fish what they are. One is that water isn't subject to sudden temperature changes. Therefore it makes an excellent habitat for a cold-blooded animal. Another advantage is the water's ability to easily support body weight. Protoplasm has approximately the same density as water, so a fish in water is almost weightless. This \"weightlessness\" in turn means two things: One, a fish can get along with a light weight and simple bone structure, and two, limitations to a fish's size are practically removed. Yet there is one basic difficulty to living in water—the fact that it's incompressible. For a fish to move through water, it must actually shove it aside. Most can do this by wiggling back and forth in snakelike motion. The fish pushes water aside by the forward motion of its head, and with the curve of its body and its flexible tail. Next, the water flows back along the fish's narrowing sides, closing in at the tail, and helping the fish propel itself forward. The fact that water is incompressible has literally shaped the development of fish. A flat and angular shape can be moved through water only with difficulty. And for this reason, fish have a basic shape that is beautifully adapted to deal with this peculiarity.",

Then everybody was crowded into factories and the new brave world opened up. In fact, one of the most interesting books and great classics that is still in print was written by an economic historian at Harvard who's still alive called David Landes. It's a good book called The Unbound Prometheus, which was basically that. Some of the inventions that I briefly describe in your reading, the spinning Jenny, etc, refer to that. Well, and that kind of analysis led one to concentrate on England where the Industrial Revolution began, and to view industrialization as beginning a situation of winners and losers by not going as fast. Now, that analysis has been really rejected greatly over the past years, because Industrial Revolution is measured by more than simply large factories with industrial workers and the number of machines. This is the point of the beginning of this.

There are three main elements that combine to create either a positive or negative experience for listeners. They can result in a voice that is pleasing to listen to and can be used effectively. Or they can create a voice that doesn't hold attention, or even worse, causes an adverse reaction. The three elements are volume, pitch, and pace. When evaluating volume, keep in mind that a good speaker will adjust to the size of both the room and the audience. Of course, with an amplifying device like a microphone, the speaker can use a natural tone. But speakers should not be dependent on microphones; a good speaker can speak loudly without shouting. The second element, pitch, is related to the highness or lowness of the sounds. High pitches are, for most people, more difficult to listen to, so in general speakers should use the lower registers of their voice. During a presentation, it's important to vary pitch to some extent in order to maintain interest. The third element, pace, that is how fast or slow words and sounds are articulated, should also be varied. A slower pace can be used to emphasize important points. Note that the time spent not speaking can be meaningful, too. Pauses ought to be used to signal transitions or create anticipation. Because a pause gives the listeners time to think about what was just said or even to predict what might come next, it can be very effective when moving from one topic to another. What I'd like you to do now is watch and listen to a videotape and use the forms I gave you to rate the speaking voices you hear.

    "question": "Humans are pretty lucky with the way we can communicate. Unlike animals, we have the perfect length necks and excellent control of our breaths. Both of these characteristics allow us to form words. Although animals can't talk like us, they still have special ways to communicate. For example, dolphins have one of the most sophisticated forms of communication. They make distinct whistling sounds that help identify themselves. Dolphins may also squeak or Yelp depending on the situation. Nevertheless, each sound release meaningful information. You have probably heard some birds say words just like us, but they are merely repeating what they hear. Most birds communicate through songs and squawks that can be beautiful for us to listen to. Other animals communicate without making a sound. Elephants show affection by wrapping their trunks around each other; whales leap out of the water to send messages to their friends; bees perform a special dance when they have located nectar in a tree.

As the name suggests, ‘microgrids’ are small scale electrical networks that operate independently, or in tandem with, large scale electrical supplies. While many national and regional electrical grids are now powered in part by renewable energy, the majority still depend on nuclear and fossil fuels to deliver the bulk of their power. Conversely, microgrids make heavy use of renewables such as photovoltaics and wind turbines to generate energy for use within a specific building or development. This enables them to power their systems and operate without adding to the demands of the wider electrical network. On-site energy production and storage can enable a new development to become self-sufficient and helps to fill in the gaps that can arise on overstretched electrical grids.",

In the face of globalization, there's a growing concern about cultural homogenization, where unique cultural practices are overshadowed by a dominant global culture. This loss of cultural diversity is not just a loss of heritage, but also of knowledge and perspectives that have been shaped over centuries. For instance, traditional arts and crafts represent more than just aesthetic value; they carry the wisdom and skills of generations. Similarly, indigenous languages, often on the brink of extinction, hold unique worldviews and knowledge about the natural world.

    "question": "The first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present indigenous people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40,000 to 43,000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60,000 to 70,000 years BP.  In any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait  The ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversify and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10,000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Peninsula.  During the 1970s and 1980s around 120,000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration Al Grassby termed \"multiculturalism\". In 2004-05, Australia accepted 123,000 new settlers, a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40,000 in 200405) moved to Sydney.

The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased. The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales.

    "question": "So, what's so special about dance and music? The answer is a long evolutionary link of life with music, though why such a link developed in the first place remains unclear. Some hypothesize that music began in the form of small rhythmic beats, like tapping one's foot. Our ancestor soon learned to coordinate with others to create more complex rhythms. One reason, some scientists think, that we began synchronizing with other people is because it allowed us to create social bonds. Several archaeological sites have found musical instruments dating back as far as 4,000 to 6,000 years ago. This long history suggests that it is beneficial to have neural connections that help us sync up with our group mates, which might have been an advantage to scare away predators as a group. This might help explain why we break out into our very own air guitar solos while listening to rock. Our brains think we're all part of the same orchestra. This mental coordination, at some point, resulted in dance. This propensity to dance and make music in groups has led scientists to propose that this might be one reason why humanity has managed to form and remain in large group of societies.

    "question": "Why does altitude cause headache? Since the air is thinner, there is less oxygen in the blood, so blood flow to the brain increases. The extra blood can cause blood vessels to swell and tissues to press on the sensitive membrane that surrounds the brain, resulting in a headache. But not everyone develops a headache at moderately high altitudes, partly because the low oxygen content of the air causes the climber to breath more often, forcing carbon dioxide out of the blood. The body reacts to the lowered carbon dioxide content of the blood by decreasing blood flow to the brain. An individual’s susceptibility to altitude-induced headache, as well as the severity of the headache, depends on whether the overall blood flow to the brain increases or decreases. At high altitudes, usually over 10,000 feet, an unrelated condition known as high-altitude cerebral edema, or HACE, can develop. HACE occurs when parts of the brain become waterlogged. Unlike altitude-induced headache, which occurs in over ninety percent of the people who ascend to 11,000 feet, HACE is a rare disorder.

MTV became the first to run TV spots promoting safe sex and AIDS awareness; issues considered far too controversial for major broadcast networks. It also addressed the problem of substance abuse with a series of “Just Say No” anti-drug spots and a “Rock Against Drugs” campaign. MTV entered the political arena when it launched the “Choose or Lose” campaign to get students politically involved by increasing voter registration. “Fight for your Rights” championed the causes of anti violence and anti-discrimination. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and MTV teamed up to form “Think: Education”, encouraging Students to graduate from high school and be prepared for the responsibilities of college and work. The channel also aired a series of pro-conservation ads called “Break the Addiction” advocating reduced energy consumption. MTV continues to address current political issues. “Think MTV”, the network’s vehicle for social activism, invites young people to choose the issues that resonate most and take action to make a positive change.",

It is called the Krebs cycle, which some of you may remember from your chemistry course in your high school. Krebs is a wonderful example to me of how a scientist who is determined can overcome all kinds of human obstacles. Krebs’s father constantly discouraged him and told him that he had just mediocre intelligence whenever to anything important in his life, as a teenager. What Krebs remembers in his memoir, his father said to him \"you can’t make a silk purse at a sow's ear\". And later on, when Krebs studied with the great biochemist Otto Warburg, Warburg also told him the same thing. Not the same quote but that he had only mediocre ability and would never be a great scientist.

    "question": "D: Yaël, what’s your favorite animal? Mine’s the giraffe. Y: What an incredible creature, Don! Giraffes are usually 14 to 19 feet tall, meaning they could easily look into your second-floor window. Their neck alone is 6 feet long, weighing about 600 pounds. And it only has seven neck vertebrae—just like humans! But have you ever wondered why giraffes have such long necks? D: I always thought it was to reach high branches of trees, especially acacias. The leaves up there are too far away for other herbivores. Over millions of years, giraffes evolved their neck to snack on this tasty foliage, without having to compete with other animals for their food source. Y: And that’s the main theory. There are other possible reasons, though. For one, being so tall lets a giraffe watch for predators. Another argument is that long necks help giraffes win fights. When male giraffes fight over a female, they strike each other with their armored heads and strong necks. Typically, the longer-necked male wins, passing down his genes to his offspring. D: You know, I’ve also heard of a study that argues that a giraffe’s unique body shape helps regulate its temperature. By being tall and narrow, a giraffe can keep most of its surface area out of direct sunlight, helping it stay cool. As for how giraffes got this way, another study suggests that these long necks developed through mutations of skeletal and cardiovascular genes.",

What they did was they took three groups of babies, all babies were seven months old so there were a bunch of Italian speaking babies, bunch of Slovenian speaking babies and a bunch of Italian-Slovenian babies from mixed families. They showed those babies various puppets and then they switched the situation. Typically when the seven-month-old baby is used to particular setting and the situation switches it takes them a little while to regroup. So turned out that seven-month-old Italian and seven-month-old Slovenian babies would get used to the puppet appearing on the right, and then when the puppet would appear on the left they would continue looking to the right as if nothing had changed.

Instincts are also often discussed in relation to motivation since they can also occur in response to an organism's need to satisfy some innate internal drive tied to survival. Instincts are present across species and are consistent within individual species. In other words, many different species rely on instincts, and if one member of a species possesses an instinct, then they all do. Before we move into a discussion of specific types of instincts, it is important to distinguish the difference between an instinct and a reflex.

So, the source of growth in travel and communication and corporate trade across borders. And this way of thinking about globalization is the continuation of thinking that has been around for a long time, such as when the Europeans went to the Orient, to find spices, which was also an example of global trade and communication. Another way to think of globalization though, is an economic system. It is a system in which countries become integrated in a way that never had been before. In this system, we see a global split in the process between consuming and producing goods. Some countries produce goods, some countries consume goods, and then these countries in different areas of the globe depend on each other in a kind of organic solidarity rather than having an economic system being just inside your country.

Email authentication is most often used to block harmful or fraudulent uses of email such as phishing and spam. In practice, we use the term “email authentication” to refer to technical standards that make this verification possible. Initially, the email system didn't consider security because there was no suspicion between them at that time, and there was no authentication process built into this system.",

    "question": "Now, what's really interesting about this time is that because of coronavirus kids have all this time to self-reflect and self-assess. And so we should be actively promoting meta learning during this time. And so what I've suggested is that we promote the idea of a learning journal. So the idea is this: Let kids decide their own learning path. Let them decide what they want to learn. It could be if they want to learn how to cook. It could be they want to learn how to drive a car. It doesn't matter. What's important is that they write down their learning journey. And so there are three components to a learning journal. First is to define the goal concretely and precisely. It's better to say I want to be able to run a marathon in less than four hours than it is to say I want to finish first in a marathon. Second is to write down the learning process. So think of a cooking recipe and writing down how you cook something. The third and most important component of a learning journal is to write down your observations, collect data, self-reflect, and develop new learning strategies for yourself. And during this process teachers don't go away. Teachers play a very important role in that they become coaches. I would say that being a coach has three main functions. The first function is to motivate the student. Second function is to identify witnesses in the learning journal.

It is a place where the living try to reconnect with lost loved ones through the skulls of strangers. The site is an ancient rock quarry. Ancient Greeks mined stones here to build, among other things, the great temples and homes of Naples. The huge caves left by excavations eventually became common graves for victims of disease and other causes during the 1600s, and for those who couldn't afford a proper burial. It was during the 1600s that Fontanelle officially started its function as a mass grave. The plague of 1656 killed many of Naples residents, and Fontanelle was used as the burial site for the deceased. According to the Associated Press, it is estimated that Fontanelle houses the remains of almost one million people, nearly all anonymous. Fontanelle became the site of another unusual custom after a priest and others put thousands of accumulated bones in the caves in order.

But when attention is overloaded, we miss things, and the result is nearly always that we perform tasks less well than we would doing them one at a time. It’s only truly possible to do two things at once if they require different sets of cognitive resources. For example, it’s totally possible to read a book and listen to music at the same time, which would suggest that driving while talking on the phone is not a problem, as long as it’s a hands-free phone. It’s not that simple though – research has shown that while talking on the phone we have a tendency to create mental images, and this uses the same visual resources needed for driving. And if visual resources become too stretched, it’s perfectly possible for a driver to look directly at a hazard but fail to see it. Not everything will make it through to conscious awareness. So multitasking makes us at best, inefficient, and at worst, downright dangerous.

But Americans have historically had large families compared to other countries, as well. But times are changing. Birth rates today have fallen to their lowest point in history. And while birth rates have historically been connected to economic cycles, the present decline is happening during good economic times. The causes of the decline will be familiar for many viewers, high housing costs, less dating and marriage, economic and social uncertainties. And even though surveys show Americans still want big families, there are no cheap, easy solutions to fix this problem. And unfortunately, the problem is self-reinforcing. Fewer children means that future generations will have fewer workers serving more people, who themselves will have less time to bear and care for children, or retirees for that matter.

Less well-known, but arguably a more pernicious problem, is the 'glass cliff'. Originally recognised by academics Michelle Ryan and Alex Haslam back in 2005, this is the phenomenon of women making it to the boardroom but finding themselves disproportionately represented in untenable leadership positions. Ryan and Haslam presented evidence that women were indeed starting to secure seats at boardroom tables. But the problem was that their positions were inherently unstable. These women would then find themselves in an unsustainable leadership position from which they would be ousted with evidence of apparent failure. The title of their paper sums it up: women are over‐represented in precarious leadership positions. Subsequent research in an array of environments has demonstrated that this is not an isolated issue, nor is it unique to certain industries or geographical locations.

    "question": "It’s time for this young loggerhead turtle to go to work. We can tether turtles in these little cloth harnesses, put them into this tank and dull swimming place. University of North Carolina biologist Ken Loman studies sea turtles that are programed from birth for an extraordinary journey. Mother turtles buried the eggs on the beach and then returned to the sea and the eggs hatch about 50 to 60 days later. Support for the National Science Foundation, Loman is learning how these reptiles use the Earth’s magnetic field to navigate a 5-to-10-year journey around the Atlantic Ocean. The turtles seem to inherit a set of responses that tell them what to do when they encounter specific magnetic fields at particular locations. This animal magnetism can be a lifesaver and one field off Portugal triggers the turtles to turn south. If they don’t, they likely die, swept into frigid North Atlantic waters. In one lab test turtles responded to magnetic field similarly to what they would encounter off the coast of Florida. The great majority of them turned South East. This is an exciting finding because southeasterly orientation in this part of the world would presumably take turtles further into the Gulfstream. So, the turtles actually have what might be considered accrued global positioning system that is based on the Earth’s magnetic field. And check out this experiment. These turtle moves may look odd. The turtles will actually act out their swimming behavior in air. But this wave simulator re-creates the first environmental cue hatchling turtles respond to.

    "question": "A sea breeze is an onshore breeze which develops around the coastlines of sea and even large lakes on warm days. In mid-latitudes, it commonly occurs during the spring and summer. This is when there is a large temperature difference between the sea and adjacent land areas. A sea breeze is a thermally driven circulation, forming due to the fact that the land heats up more quickly than the sea. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and so requires more energy to raise the temperature. As the sun radiates energy at more or less a constant rate, it will take longer for the water to heat up. This means that peak sea surface temperatures aren't reached until early autumn. This differential heating of adjacent land and sea surfaces is the main factor in the formation of sea breezes. A temperature difference of around 3 degrees Celsius is required for sea breeze to start to develop. Other factors that are required for sea breezes to form are light offshore winds at around 3000 feet. This aids the higher level flow out to sea to get the process started.",

    "question": "Pernis, near Rotterdam, Europe's biggest refinery, owned by Europe's biggest energy company, never in its 115-year history has Shell made more money than it did in the first three months of this year. Shell made underlying profits of 7.2 billion pounds in the first three months of this year alone. That's triple the amount they made in the same period last year. How come? Well the global price of oil, already high at the end of last year as the world economy emerged from its coveted slumber, surged again on concerns that the conflict in Ukraine could see Russian oil supplies disrupted or boycotted. Similar story for gas. The price smashed records earlier this year. Remember, Russia is the world's biggest exporter of gas, and Europe is its biggest customer. Those global prices have been reflected on UK four courts and in UK energy bills. So what is Shell going to do with all that money? Well, in the first three months of the year, it gave over four billion pounds to its shareholders, which, remember, include millions of UK pension savers, but it's also promised to invest up to 25 billion pounds in the UK over the next decade mainly on renewables and low carbon technology but some new oil and gas to help improve the UK's future energy security.

Both sides of the legal team - prosecution and defence - are likely to rely to some extent on witnesses and on what they can recall of events that led up to or indeed formed part of the criminal act. Now it's been well established in various circles that memory can be unreliable, particularly if new information is introduced in cross-examination that hasn't been presented up until that point - new facts that witnesses were unaware of. A lot of research has been done to test the effects of this and it can be very problematic. For example, if you show a group of subjects a video of a crime, then you get someone else to read them an account of the same crime, but adding in information, be it ideas or objects that weren't present on the video. What researchers have found is that when the subjects are asked to re-tell what they saw on the video, they too include a number of things that were never there. In other words, the introduction of new information in a court of law is very likely to skew or distort a witness' memory of the event.",

    "question": "Coal is a black or dark brown combustible rock made primarily of carbon. It was formed millions of years ago when ferns, plants, and trees died and fell into swamps. The swamp conditions prevented the organisms from decaying completely, and after millions of years of intense heat and pressure, coal was formed. Coal is classified into four main types or ranks based on carbon and heat content: lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, anthracite. The general rule is that the higher the grade of coal, the cleaner it burns, and the more versatile its uses. Coal is extracted from the earth through underground mining or surface mining. The choice of mining method is largely determined by the geology of the coal deposit and its distance from the surface. Underground mining currently accounts for a larger share of world coal production than surface mining. Coal can be burned for heating or to produce electricity. To convert thermal coal to electricity, it is first milled to a fine powder which increases the surface area and allows it to burn more quickly. The hot gases and heat energy produced from combustion converts water into steam to run a turbine and generator. High quality coal is also a useful raw material. For example, it can be converted to Coke for steel-making. Coal can also be converted to liquid or synthetic gas by advanced chemical processes, making it a possible but costly replacement for natural gas or liquid fuels for transportation",

The majority of sleep-clinic patients suffer from disorders of excessive sleep, or \"hypersomnia.\" While most insomniacs somehow manage to drag themselves through the day and function at acceptable, although not optimal levels, this is not so for people who suffer from hypersomnia. They are incapacitated by irresistible urges to sleep during the day, often in inappropriate situations--at business meetings, in supermarkets, or at parties. Even more dangerous is their failure to remain awake when driving or operating machinery. Falling asleep in such situations could obviously be life-threatening. Many hypersomniacs suffer from narcolepsy, for which the primary symptom is excessive daytime sleepiness. Though not apparent in childhood, this symptom most often appears for the first time during the teen years and continues throughout a person's life. The sleep attacks may occur as many as fifteen to twenty times during the course of the day and last for periods from fifteen minutes up to two hours.

    "question": "With an abundance of low-priced labor relative to the United States, it is no surprise that China, India and other developing countries specialize in the production of labor-intensive products. For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human- and physical-capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States. This division of global production should yield higher global output of both types of goods than would be the case if each country attempted to produce both of these goods itself. For example, the United States would produce more expensive labor-intensive goods because of its more expensive labor and the developing countries would produce more expensive human and physical capital-intensive goods because of their relative scarcity of these inputs. This logic implies that the United States is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the production of green technologies that are not relatively intensive in human and physical capital. Nevertheless, during the early stages of the development of a new technology, the United States has a comparative advantage in the production of the products enabled by this innovation.

    "question": "In central-east Africa, there lives a small, slow-growing, scruffy tree that residents call mpingo, from the Swahili for \"the ebony tree.\" Mpingo is true to its namesake, with wood that ranges from reddish to pure black. Mpingo wood gains remarkable stability from the layer of sapwood that divides its bark from its inner hardwood. Its hardiness has been a factor in both the tree's success and its endangerment. For the last hundred years or so mpingo wood has been the primary material used to make clarinets, and other small woodwind instruments in many commercial markets. But mpingo trees take 75 to 100 years to reach harvestable size, and rates of harvest have far outstripped the tree's slow growth. One 2009 study found that poor conservation had left these grassland trees with low germination rates that result in decreased biodiversity. The trees need gene diversity to keep their populations productive. It's important to point out that this blackwood variety of African rosewood came to popularity after the Central American ebony Cocuswood was depleted in the early 1900s: it had been the staple for woodwind instrument manufacturing up to that point. But in Tanzania, where mpingo is the national tree, conservation helps to keep it from being threatened. One effort called Clarinets for Conservation uses music education to inform young Tanzanians about the importance of their national tree, and how to get involved in protecting natural resources. Also, farmers plant mpingo in lowlands, where the tree can easily withstand grassfires that other plants often cannot. Their efforts help the tree of music to continue to thrive.",

    "question": "All right, class. Yesterday, I told you that we were going to start looking at a field of psychology called developmental psychology. This branch of psychology looks at the many ways people's minds and bodies develop from before they're even born until they die. So we should just start at the beginning. I think. Let's start with infants. So, when a baby is born up until he or she starts talking, the baby is referred to as an infant. Infants can't do a lot of things that older children can do. Let's look at the physical side of things. Babies are born with really poor vision. Actually, they're legally blind when born. Infants can mostly make out large shapes and stuff, but they can't tell detail. Also, their sense of color isn't very good. For a long time, psychologists thought infants were colorblind right after birth. As it turns out, research has shown that most babies can, in fact, make out bright colors. For example, an infant can tell the difference between a bright red ball and a bright blue ball. But it would be much harder for an infant to tell the difference between a light blue ball and a dark blue ball. Anyway, as infants get older, their sense of sight improves. Some psychologists think that by the age of six months, an infant's vision will be almost the same as an adult's.",

    "question": "Transportation refers to systems which are designed to move people and goods. It provides people with access to what they value and need, to live their lives, build economies, and interact with the environment. Transportation is the backbone of a global network that trades over 18 trillion worth of goods and moves the world's population over 81 trillion kilometers every year. The system also impacts the climate. As of 2015, transportation accounted for 23% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. One way to understand this complex system is by breaking it down into three different components: mode, fuel type, and technology. Modes of transportation allow people and goods to move across air, land, and sea. People often move by human power, cars, and planes, while goods are transported by truck, rail, or ship. Fuel is the crucial element that propels the transportation system. The primary fuel types are derived from human power, renewable fuels and fossil fuels. Different fuels and how they are consumed have distinct impacts on the climate and our air quality. When petroleum products are burned in vehicle engines, they release energy, but they also release greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Currently 95 percent of transportation is fueled by petroleum. However, other fuels like electricity and biofuels are becoming increasingly prevalent as we adopt new technologies. Technology refers to what the vehicle uses to move, like an internal combustion engine in a gas car or an electric motor in an electric vehicle. Technology is very greatly in efficiency. Efficiency determines how much of the fuel is actually used to propel a vehicle versus energy lost in the process",

    "question": "Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface and is vital to our daily lives. It can also be a clean, renewable, reliable source of electricity. Hydroelectric energy comes from capturing the force of moving water that's in our Earth's rivers and oceans. We do this by using the movement of the water to spin hydraulic turbines. That generates kinetic energy which is converted to electricity through a generator and then sent to the power grid. Most hydropower is generated from dams built on rivers and streams, often where there's a big drop in elevation, so gravity can help us out. Dams block the water's natural flow and force it through a large pipe with the turbine and generator, before releasing it back into the stream on the other side of the dam. Today we know that dams, most of which were built before the 1960s here in the US, can disrupt river ecosystems. There haven't been many new hydro plants built in the U.S. in a few decades, but some existing dams are beginning to be tapped for their electricity generating potential, and existing hydro facilities are being upgraded to be less harmful to plants, fish, and wildlife.

Although glasses spread quickly throughout Europe and Asia, there was one major problem: keeping them on the wearer's face.

At least that's the number our world in data has tallied up, but we've known for quite some time that is a pretty severe underestimate. For one, not all covid-19 deaths have been tested, recorded on death certificates and counters. Speaker: Those numbers should be recorded and in this day and age; it's incredible that we don't have registration systems, so we can't, um, catalogue the departure. Host: And then there's a whole host of other indirect impacts of the pandemic on health and mortality that aren't captured in the covid figures. That's why the WHO has tried to estimate what's called excess mortality; put simply, try to work out how many more people have died of all causes than you'd expect to see in an ordinary non-pandemic here, and when they did that, they reached an estimate of about 15 million deaths. Some countries have recorded far more excess deaths than others through the pandemic. Peru is one example; another is India.

And it's no wonder: studies show the commercials' work: consumers go to their doctors with a suggestion for a prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message these ads promote, NPRs Patty Neighmond reports. You're most likely to see drug ads during prime time, especially around the news. Researchers analyzed 38 ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpes, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis, and allergies. The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. But researchers found that though the information was technically accurate, the tone was misleading. UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch headed the study. \"What we would see in these ads is that before taking the prescription drug, the character's life was out of control and the loss of control really extended beyond just the impact of the health condition, \" For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days, insomniacs utterly out of synch on the job and depressed patients friendless and boring at parties. \"When the character is then shown taking the drug, he then magically regains complete control of his life.\" None of the ads, of course, mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition.

    "question": "In fact, a lot of what we perceive as flavor comes from odor molecules that float up to our smell receptors through our mouths. And as with taste, studies have shown the visual cues we get from color help us identify smells more quickly and accurately. In fact, one 1981 study found that the source of a smell doesn't have to be the corresponding color. The color and odor just sort of need to be in the same place. Like, the author of this study found that if an odor was presented along with colored words or patches, subjects could identify it faster and more accurately than odors presented with inappropriate color cues. So as an example, the smell of lemon would likely be easier to identify in a yellow room than in a pink room. Which sounds strange. But what all this research adds up to is very clear evidence that color influences our perception of smell and taste. What's less clear is why this happens. Scientists have not nailed down one single answer, but there are a few possibilities. The first is that the appearance of food or drinks produces what some researchers call an expectancy-based effect. Basically the color of something tells you what to expect, and your expectation is actually enough to overpower reality and influence the way you identify a taste or smell. This idea is similar to the placebo effect, where people's beliefs about a treatment actually change the symptoms they experience. Another way color could influence how we identify a flavor or smell is by directing our attention.",

The practice has also been shown to be a potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with a variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain and improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing exercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat conditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise and regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic for lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane that brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting those passageways and improve oxygen diffusion.

Experts say about 9 million people visit the bridge each year. They say more than 1,000 million vehicles have used the bridge since it opened almost 70 years ago. The bridge has always been painted the color called \"International Orange\". The color was chosen because it went well with the natural surroundings. It is also easier to see in the heavy fog that often covers the area. But the Golden Gate Bridge was not named for its orange color. It was named for the body of water that it crosses, the Golden Gate Strait. The Golden Gate Strait is the entrance to the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean.

They've been told to participate in the exercise program without changing their diet. After careful observation, the researchers actually found that some volunteers experienced a body fat change after six months from the day they've started the experiment. The finding further stated that some actually lost a significant amount of fat, which led to a decrease in body mass. On the other hand, there were others who did not lose fat at all. So, I guess, the study concludes that there must be two explanations. Those who did not lose weight must have eaten more.

Preserving these ecosystems is not only a moral duty but also vital for our survival. One compelling argument for habitat conservation is its role in biodiversity. Natural habitats are home to a wide array of species, many of which are interconnected in intricate ecological webs. When these habitats are destroyed, entire ecosystems can collapse, leading to the extinction of species and loss of valuable genetic diversity. Furthermore, natural habitats provide numerous ecosystem services, such as clean air and water, pollination, and climate regulation. Protecting these habitats safeguards these critical services, which are essential for human well-being and the health of the planet.

If the brain feels no pain, what is brain freeze? Brain freeze, also called an ice cream headache, occurs when you eat or drink something cold too quickly. When ice cream touches the roof of your mouth, the blood vessels in your mouth contract. This sends a message to the brain about a change in your body heat. The brain overreacts and tries to conserve heat by contracting the blood vessels in your head. When the threat is over, the blood vessels in the head relax and dilate. This sends a quick rush of blood to the head. You feel this rush of blood as pain in your temples, face, or neck, but not in your brain.

You remove pieces from the Jenga tower and everything seems to be okay. And then you remove one piece and the whole thing falls down. And you don’t know which piece in advance that’s going to be and once you’ve removed it, you can’t put it back again. So the loss of species is inevitably concerning, because often we don’t know what those species are doing. We don’t know what other species are depending on them.” Insects make up the largest class of animals on earth, and represent more than half of all known living organisms. They are incredibly diverse, and in many ways make life on Earth possible. Bees and butterflies pollinate our food, flowers and trees. They feed all kinds of larger animals, including humans. And insects play a vital role in the decomposition of all kinds of organic matter, from leaves to roadkill. Their collapse is being driven by human activity, everything from traffic to industrial farming and pesticides to light pollution.

Sometimes a charismatic leader such as Martin Luther King Jr. can define goals and mobilize energies through rhetoric and the power of example. We can think of leadership as a spectrum, in terms of both visibility and the power the leader wields. On one end of the spectrum, we have the most visible: authoritative leaders like the president of the United States or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, or a dictator such as Hitler or Qaddafi. At the opposite end of the spectrum is casual, low-key leadership found in countless situations every day around the world, leadership that can make a significant difference to the individuals whose lives are touched by it. Over the centuries, the first kind–the out-in-front, authoritative leadership–has generally been exhibited by men. Some men in positions of great authority, including Nelson Mandela, have chosen a strategy of “leading from behind”; more often, however, top leaders have been quite visible in their exercise of power.

At its roots, architecture exists to create the physical environment in which people live, but architecture is more than just the built environment, it’s also a part of our culture. It stands as a representation of how we see ourselves, as well as how we see the world. There are poorly designed buildings, but also some great building works. In the Victoria Era, architects designed buildings based on bricks and other materials. The design of flaws was based on lighting as it would not only affect appearance but also health conditions. The materials that buildings are made of also matter. For example, the design of ground floors must ensure that the building is able to withstand the weight of the higher levels. In the 20th century, many old buildings with design flaws were demolished or modified through a natural selection process, which means they are an altered state rather than an original state. This is an application of Darwin's theory of natural selection to modification of old buildings, which means buildings should adapt to the new world to survive, or be pulled down. So, it's argued to be unfair to criticize the demolition, although some people believe that whether to be remained should be decided based on their nature and functions.

The need for electricity storage is due to an imbalance in supply and demand on the electrical grid due primarily to an increase in renewable energy generation. These supply and demand discrepancies occur because renewables are intermittent, meaning electricity isn't produced when the Sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing, even though consumers still require electricity in these renewable downtimes. Currently, grids distribute electricity in real time, meaning electricity is being consistently produced to meet consumer demand. Electricity storage gives grid operators the flexibility to use electricity that otherwise would be wasted. This grid flexibility is highly sought after and has the potential to transform how we produce and consume electricity and is therefore being widely researched and tested.

In other words, people with a fixed mindset worry the most about how they are judged, while those with a growth mindset focus the most on learning. There are other consequences of mindset: people with a fixed mindset see effort as a bad thing, something that only people with low capabilities need, while those with a growth mindset see effort as what makes us smart, as the way to grow. And when they hit a set-back or a failure, people with a fixed mindset tend to conclude that they are incapable. So to protect their ego, they lose interest or withdraw. We observe that as lack of motivation. But behind it is a fixed mindset, whereas people with a growth mindset understand that set backs are part of growth. So when they hit one, they find a way around it. Like Josh Waitzkin did when he lost in chess or in martial arts.",

Is that because my hat looks kind of like a beret, or for some other reason? Y: Well, Don… because it might be easier to lie in a foreign language. A little background first: according to the cognitive load hypothesis, lying should be harder in a foreign language because both lying and speaking in a foreign language make your brain work harder. But according to the emotional distance hypothesis, lying should be easier in a foreign language because speaking in a foreign language is less emotionally arousing than speaking in your native tongue, so the stress you feel while lying gets dampened. To see which hypothesis won out, psychologists had participants lie or tell the truth while answering questions. They found that participants generally took longer to lie than to tell the truth, but that the time difference shrank when the participant was speaking in a foreign language. But that's because it took participants longer to tell the truth in a foreign language — not because participants could lie faster. The researchers think they can explain their results using both hypotheses: people took longer to tell the truth in a foreign language because the extra cognitive load of speaking a different language made it harder. Lying should have taken even longer because it makes the brain work even harder, but the emotional distance that speaking in a foreign language creates canceled out some or all of that extra cognitive load.",

And in one teaspoon of soil, there are more microorganisms than there are people on the Earth. But much of what lies beneath, in this hidden and deep universe, is still alien to us. Despite being literally under our feet, humans have so far only identified a tiny fraction of the extraordinary life teeming underground. But these animals and microorganisms provide an invaluable role. Millions of years of evolutionary competition have led the microorganisms to produce antibiotic compounds to fight their neighbors.

    "question": "Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are warming Earth’s climate. The climate crisis has widespread ramifications. Ecologists are worried that many species will become extinct, because they might not be able to adapt to a climate change that’s faster than most naturally occurring ones. It’s possible that some plants and animals could adapt by shifting their habitats towards Earth’s poles, or towards higher elevations, to avoid the heat. Since ecosystems are varied and complex, ecologists can only find out by studying many specific cases. A team of American ecologists explored this possibility for a species of hummingbirds native to North America’s west coast, called Anna’s Hummingbird. The researchers published their findings in 2022. Anna’s Hummingbirds live in California’s lowlands, but migrate up-slope into the cooler mountains during the summer. If climate warming continues, the team hypothesized, the birds might adapt by migrating farther up. To test whether this was really possible, the researchers studied the effects of relocating a group of Anna’s Hummingbirds to a higher altitude. They captured the birds from across their normal range in the Sierra Nevada, and moved them to a research station near a mountain peak, four thousand feet higher than the birds normally venture. They found that the hummingbirds had big difficulties adapting to the lower air pressure and oxygen levels, which caused a drop in their metabolic rate and flight efficiency. Although the researchers still want to study the effects of longer exposure, their tentative conclusion was that it would be hard for the birds to adapt. Their results remind us how complicated an animal’s environmental requirements are.",

    "question": "Everyone knows you should put spinach and berries in the refrigerator, but exactly how do cooler temperatures keep most fruits and vegetables from spoiling rapidly? Spoilage is inevitable, but refrigeration slows it down in two ways. First, cold temperatures interfere with the growth of microorganisms that harm food, such as bacteria, mold, and yeast. In order to grow, any microorganism that could damage fruits or vegetables needs food, a favorable moisture content, and a favorable temperature. Obviously, it is impossible to eliminate a food source for these microorganisms, so other factors that facilitate their growth must be eliminated. We refrigerate food to keep bacteria, yeasts, and molds from the favorable temperature they need to grow. The moisture-control available in many refrigerators also helps slow the deterioration of foods, so that two of the three favorable situations for microorganism growth are eliminated. Though the microorganism growth is slowed down at low temperatures, it still can occur at the 38 degrees of an ordinary refrigerator. Hence, the mold that grows on forgotten leftovers in the back of a refrigerator. The second benefit of refrigeration is that it slows down the food's own natural processes that lead to ripening and eventual decay. For fruits and vegetables, the very chemical processes that cause plants to grow and ripen also cause them to rot. In effect, refrigeration helps save the plant tissue from itself. Keeping these foods at low temperatures dramatically slows this aging process.",

The planets are shown to revolve in a nice circular path, forming concentric rings, with the Sun sitting smack-dab in the center. While this vision of planets following a nice circular path around the Sun looks neat and tidy for a school project, in reality, things aren’t that simple. The planets in our solar system don’t really revolve in perfectly circular orbits. Instead, they generally have a stretched version of a circle, which is technically called an ellipse. How stretched you’d ask? Well, that depends on the orbital eccentricity that the planets possess. Too much mathematics going over your head already? Well, let’s get the basics down first! An ellipse is a symmetrically shaped closed oval. It has two points, called foci, which act as a combined center for an ellipse. This ellipse has an important property called eccentricity. Simply put, eccentricity tells how much the ellipse deviates from the perfect circle. Mathematically, the value of eccentricity varies between zero and one, with zero representing a circle and one transforming into another shape, called a parabola. For planetary objects, when orbital eccentricity crosses 1, the planet no longer remains confined to the star, and it ‘escapes’ from its gravitational influence.",

Traditionally, companies stored enough stock to meet current demand but also kept an extra amount in case there was a problem or a sudden increase in demand for their product. This was called 'Just in Case'. But in the 1970s Ono realised that storing excess parts and components cost Toyota money. So he devised a system where instead of storing parts, the company only ordered what was needed, making sure that parts arrived 'Just in Time' the moment they were required. And so 'Just in Time' was born. The results were spectacular. Just in time increased Toyota's profits and freed up enormous amounts of capital that had been tied up in expensive warehousing. This enabled Toyota to reinvest, expand and stay ahead of the competition.

They want whoever they’re interacting with—typically a parent—to smile back. And they time it just so, a smile here and a smile there. The researchers call it sophisticated timing. The study is in the journal PLoS ONE.  The researchers enlisted real mothers and infants and quantified their interactions, which fell into four categories.

Three: they wanted to experience simultaneous smiling, and four: no smiling at all.  By studying when smiles happened and what the subsequent effect was, the investigators were able to figure out that for mothers the goal 70 percent of the time was to be smiling simultaneously—while for babies 80 percent of the time they just wanted their mother smiling at them. So, mothers want the interaction, while babies just want to be smiled at.  So your baby may not be able to feed itself, talk or even turn over yet.

    "question": "General Electric developed several medical devices in emerging markets that were a little simpler and a lot less expensive. In China, they developed a compact portable ultrasound machine from scratch. It cost just $15,000 compared with over $100,000 for their high end model. Although it didn’t have all the bells and whistles, it was a hit in China’s rural clinics. That’s when G.E. realized that American doctors could use it too. Not to compete with the more expensive product, but for new uses. In situations where portability was important or space was tight. This is what Vijay Govindarajan and Chris Trimble call reverse innovation. Not only does it result in products that address market needs in emerging economies, it also creates new sales opportunities in developed ones. Reverse innovation can be tough to pull off but there are two reasons to try. First, because emerging markets have larger populations and lower per capita GDP’s, they’re especially sensitive to many of the forces affecting competition in global markets today. Products built for emerging markets are more likely to be well suited to issues that ultimately affect every market. Second, as emerging market companies grow, they’ll be looking to export their own products often at much lower prices, which incumbent firms will find tough to beat. Practicing reverse innovation today will help protect incumbent firms from being disrupted by low cost competitors tomorrow.",

    "question": "Nuclear energy is the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. Releasing this energy from the atom is what gives way to usable nuclear energy. The main way this is done is through nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to split apart atoms to form smaller atoms, which, in turn, releases energy and generates heat that typically turns a turbine. Solar energy, on the other hand, harnesses power from the sun. We can take radiation in the form of light from the sun and convert it into electricity. This is typically done through photovoltaic, or PV, cells, which are made of semi-conductive materials like silicon. When sunlight is absorbed by PV cells, photons of light transfer that energy to electrons, which, in turn, creates energy in the form of an electric current as the electrons flow through the material. As such, solar energy is classified as a renewable energy source, since it is a source of energy that can theoretically regenerate and replenish itself indefinitely. While some argue that nuclear energy should also be classified as renewable, most agree that it is, more accurately, a sustainable energy source. This means that while nuclear power may not be seen as infinite, the rate that it is consumed is insignificant compared to the amount of the supply. It’s like the kale of energy sources. Sure, there is only a finite amount of the stuff, but who would ever eat so much of it that the world would run out?",

    "question": "I am glad to stand here today, to talk about a critical geographical phenomenon impacting urban areas globally: the Urban Heat Island effect. This effect refers to the observable fact that urban regions often experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings, a consequence of modern urban development. The primary cause is the extensive use of concrete, asphalt, and other materials in urban construction that absorb and retain heat. Additionally, the dearth of vegetation in cities as compared to rural areas further exacerbates this effect. For instance, on hot summer days, cities like New York or Tokyo can be several degrees warmer than their surrounding countryside. The implications of the Urban Heat Island effect are significant. It leads to increased energy consumption as people rely more on air conditioning, contributes to the worsening of air quality, and exacerbates the effects of heatwaves, posing a health risk to urban populations. To mitigate this, cities must adopt greener practices, such as planting more trees, creating urban green spaces, and using lighter-colored, heat-reflective materials in construction. Addressing the Urban Heat Island effect is not just about improving comfort; it's about creating sustainable, livable urban environments for future generations.\"",

Below them, those who still have non-computerized jobs, and who will naturally be mainly providing services to the wealthy. And underneath them, the jobless masses: the majority of humanity. Things look pretty grim in this future. The first consequence is predictably extreme inequality. Under our current means tested, insufficient, work-conditional methods of welfare distribution, and the total absence of a capital wealth accumulation, existing trends will only continue to drive larger and larger gaps between the rich and the poor. The effects of inequality we see today will only become more extreme. And with even less recourse to organized power. That leads to the second dramatic consequence of highly automated capitalist society: corporate totalitarianism. A capitalist monopoly on robots virtually guarantees an even more dangerous monopoly on violence. If the ruling elite are no longer reliant on the working class to flourish, workers will be regarded as useless. And if they tried to fight back for a better society that benefits the majority, the capitalist state and corporate elite can use their monopoly on technology to crush resistance in even more frightening ways.",

And at that time, what he'd noticed was there were these soldiers that were coming down from the Swiss Alps to fight wars in the plains of Europe who were feeling very anxious and distressed. And so he coined the term 'nostalgia' to represent this pain associated with people's longing for their homeland - and he saw it very much as a disease. If you fast forward to the present day, you would discover that nostalgia is actually considered a psychological resource. It's actually very helpful for our health and well-being. And what we discovered through careful experimentation using tools of modern behavioral science, is that it's actually not the case that nostalgia makes people miserable. It's when people are miserable that they turn to nostalgia and nostalgia doesn't reinforce that misery, it actually comforts them.

To pass the test, a computer must be able to replace one of the players without substantially changing the results. In other words, a computer would be considered intelligent if its conversation couldn’t be easily distinguished from a human’s.

    "question": "When human females are pregnant, they're advised to stay away from alcohol, for fear of harming the fetus. And most parents refrain from giving their infants bottles full of whiskey or beer, for obvious reasons. But if you're a fruit fly, literally dousing your offspring in alcohol is apparently one of the best ways to protect them from danger, particularly from certain types of wasps. How and why? Let's back up a bit. First, certain types of wasps prey on fruit flies by injecting eggs inside fruit fly larvae. Unless an infected larva kills the wasp egg, it hatches and the wasp larva eats its way out from inside the fruit fly larva, killing it. One way for fruit fly moms to protect against this gruesome fate is to lay their eggs in an alcohol soaked environment, such as fermenting fruit, when they see that parasitic wasps are around. Although alcohol is toxic to fruit flies, it's even more toxic to wasps, which, unlike fruit flies, have not evolved a high level of alcohol tolerance. So if the larvae eat enough alcohol rich food, it can kill the wasp egg and keep it from hatching. Apparently, fruit flies are not the only fly species to use alcohol to protect their young. In fact, it seems that most flies that eat rotting fruit use the alcohol defense against wasps. So fruit flies are not unique in this regard, but they're still mighty impressive.",

Gender diversity in positions of power not only promotes equity but also drives innovation and progress. One compelling argument for the importance of women in leadership is the diversity of perspectives they bring. Women often approach problem-solving and decision-making differently, adding valuable insights to organizations and fostering creativity. Furthermore, women in leadership serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. Their success inspires young girls and women to pursue their ambitions and break down gender barriers across various fields. As we move forward, it's essential to continue advocating for and promoting women in leadership roles. By embracing gender diversity at all levels of society, we can create more inclusive, equitable, and dynamic environments that benefit us all.",

In another lecture, I'm going to deal with what is this now called, megalopolis - cities with populations of ten million or more. However, first I want to go back in history to when the population of cities could be numbered in the thousands rather than millions. One of the earliest theorists of the city was, of course, Plato, who created an ideal city in his text, The Republic. The population of this city would be around twenty-five to thirty thousand at most. Oddly enough, the same figures were chosen by Leonardo da Vinci for his ideal cities. Now, of these twenty five to thirty thousand inhabitants only about five thousand would be citizens. A reason for this might be that it is the largest number that could be addressed publicly at one time and by one person, and makes a voting system much easier to manage. Also, perhaps the numbers are kept deliberately low because a large population would be harder to control, or because, in practical terms, fewer inhabitants are easier to feed from local supplies without having to depend on outside sources.",

In fact, he was quite concerned about the way music could either degrade or elevate the minds of young people. So you can see, in some sense, nothing has changed. He said rhythm and harmony find their ways into the inward places of soul. Well, yes, that's true and he said this in 400 BC. But what has changed since then? It's just in the last few years, brain science has started to seriously investigate music and this young science is confirming music's power over us. For example, some colleagues in Montreal decided to do a study to investigate what happens in the brain when people get chills to music. This is intense emotional responses that often manifest themselves as shivers tingling of the spines. Anybody here had this? OK, it's not uncommon. And they specifically looked at chills instrumental music. So this wasn't due to any associations that people had with lyrics. It was just sounds of music and they looked it. They took advantage of the fact that people often know quite well what music gives them chills they know piece, sometimes the very passage in the piece and so they had people bring in their own self- selected CDs and they scan their brains while they were having these experiences listening to music.",

But with one loan coming from here, another from there, I had no idea of the rockslide that was building. Fifteen years later, I still experience moments of sheer horror regarding my family's financial situation. My monthly student loan payment is more than triple my car payment. OK, so without my college degree, I would not have been able to get my current job. For that I'm grateful; but at what cost? My loans have been accruing at a rate of 10 percent, and now they have burgeoned to—well, I'm an English major, you do the math. I don't think they'll ever get paid off. We're in debt way past our eyeballs, and there's no hope in sight. I'm being kept in class—a financial class of graduates whose only hope for attending college meant borrowing money from the government. Because of our mounting credit card debt and monthly payments that far exceed our family's income; my kids will also join the class of citizens who can't rely on their parents for college support. Do I wish I'd chosen another educational route? You bet. Perhaps trade school — I've thought that being a plumber might not be such a bad gig. But if your job aspirations require a four-year degree, take my advice and choose a college you can afford, both during and after graduation. Take a realistic look at your anticipated income, and factor in priorities that don't carry a price — like the spouse and children you might want to have some day.

It's composed of an iron rich core, plus a mantle and crust containing minerals made of magnesium, oxygen and silicon. The moon's surface was once geologically active and covered in an ocean of magma. But today, apart from traces of water ice, the surface is completely covered in dust and rocky debris. Countless craters dot the moon's surface. Each formed by objects such as meteroids, comets and asteroids crashing onto the moon. The largest crater, the South Pole Aitkin basin, spans across a quarter of the moon's surface, and is nearly deep enough to fit Mount Everest inside. The moon orbits our planet at an average distance of 30 Earths. It rotates at the same rate that it revolves. So as it revolves around our planet, the same side of the moon faces the Earth at all times.

    "question": "Steam is water that’s heated to two hundred twelve degrees Fahrenheit. Believe it or not, steam is invisible -- you can see right through it! If you look closely at the end of your kettle's spout, you'll notice that the white stuff doesn't start right away. It begins billowing about half an inch away from the nozzle, with clear gas in between. This clear gas is the actual steam. The billowy white stuff is what the steam turns into when it hits the drier, cooler air of your kitchen. Those white billows are, in fact, clouds, not steam. In many ways, they are identical to the clouds you can see in the sky. The white color comes from tiny liquid water droplets that have condensed from the steam. More accurately, these billows are a type of cloud called a “mixing cloud.” These can form when two separate air masses -- with different temperatures and different amounts of water in them -- mix together. In the case of your kettle, the hot, steamy gas cools rapidly in the kitchen air, and this sudden coolness is what makes some of the vapor condense. Mixing clouds are pretty common, and they don't need to start with steam. You see mixing clouds when you “see your breath” on a cold winter day. You’ll find them rising from a bowl of warm soup. Wherever there’s a mixing cloud, you can bet some warm, moist air is mixing with air that's cooler and drier.",

    "question": "Have you ever wondered how people got ice before they had refrigerators? For thousands of years people have been finding creative ways to collect and store ice, even when it's hot out. You can harvest it off mountains where it's frozen at high altitudes, or even in the desert where water freezes overnight. People would take this ice, pack it together as densely as possible to insulate it from the heat, then store it in ice houses: subterranean structures that kept it dark and cool. In ancient Persia, ice was stored in a yakhchāl: a large underground storage chamber with a tall conical roof that allowed warm air to rise and escape out the top. Back then, year-round ice was a luxury good consumed by the wealthy. It was mostly used to make desserts and iced drinks. It wasn't until the nineteenth century that ice became an industry. In the 1800s, people began harvesting ice in huge blocks cut from lakes and ponds in New England then shipping it all over the world by barge or railroad. By the 1860s, access to ice transformed the way meat and produce were stored and transported in the United States. Ice entered the American household shortly after ice became an industry.

    "question": "To start with, we need to understand why we age in the first place. Aside from the existential dread it may cause, ageing is a complex process whereby there is a progressive loss of the body’s ability to maintain itself. Your body runs on finely tuned chemical machinery, proteins, and the cell's instruction manual - DNA. Like all machinery, proteins break, malfunction and accumulate errors over time. Highly reactive chemicals called free radicals are produced by metabolism, and through exposure to the environment, such as UV rays, they can damage proteins and DNA. To prevent this, cells constantly maintain order and cleanliness. The cell’s maintenance mechanisms repair damaged DNA, discard old proteins, and signal the cell to make new proteins. Eventually, the cell becomes too damaged and cannot work anymore. The body makes more cells to replace these old ones. However, cells have an internal limit - defined by their DNA - on how many times they can divide, meaning that we can't keep creating new cells forever. Over time, with fewer new cells to replace old ones and with the damage piling up, it becomes difficult to maintain our youth. This is part of what leads to the physical manifestations of old age, as well as some common diseases, such as cancer and diabetes. So, logically, if we could have more young cells and maintain our existing cells better, we wouldn't get as sick and broken down when we're older.",

It takes a lot of parental attention, energy, and love before a child crosses the stage at a high school graduation. Social networks are critical to finding a full-time job.

The idea was built on the classical liberalism of the 18th Century and a defence of individual liberty, protecting private property and the freedom of markets from external interference - taxes, regulations, levies - as much as possible.

    "question": "One of the most amazing things that have happened even in my lifetime is the prediction of cosmology. When I started out forty-odd years ago, we thought we knew that the universe began a big bang, some people doubted even then. We thought the universe was about ten or twenty billion years old. But now for really very sound scientific reasons, we can say that the universe did start in a Big bang and it’s 13.8 billion years old. So it’s not 14, it's not 13 because a decimal point in there and that’s a stunning achievement to know that. And we also know that the laws of physics that apply to tiny particles inside atoms also explains what happened in the big bang, you can’t have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply nuclear physics, that kind of physics to understand how stars work, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So their universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic, if we done it and counted in the other way around and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say science was in deep trouble. But it’s not, everything fits together and we know how the universe began, we got to know how the way it is. The future that it ‘ll suspects we don’t know quite well what’s going, but we got some ideas, which are as good as those ideas we had 40 years ago about how big bang happened.",

And the argument is that Apple has been telling you this story over and over again, that Apple is the brand for hip, cool, fun, creative people. This is the true power of brands. They can influence our behavior in ways that extend way beyond the point of sale. So to what degree can the influence of brands wreak havoc on our ability to make rational spending decisions? This is Americus Reed. He studies identity and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania. When I make choices about different brands, I’m choosing to create an identity. When I put that shirt on, when I put those shoes on, those jeans, that hat, someone is going to form an impression about what I’m about. So if I’m choosing Nike over Under Armor, I’m choosing a kind of different way to express affiliation with sport. The Nike thing is about performance. The Under Armor thing is about the underdog. I have to choose which of these different conceptual pathways is most consistent with where I am in my life.

Somebody made it to fool people and make money. Other people think it’s probably a code. In other words, someone encoded lots of secrets in it, hoping that no one would find out. And if so, that’s been very successful because no one has corrected it so far. But, in my opinion, it is actually a genuine script. Obviously, a human devised script but masking behind it a genuine human language. In a language, it seems to me to have more if you like Near Eastern, maybe Caucasian Asian aspects, to it rather than European because of some of the words that I’ve decoded.

    "question": "The first controlled and sustained flight of an airplane was conducted in December of 1903 by the Wright Brothers. Years passed and airplanes became increasingly more sophisticated and powerful, but their design and functionality had several limitations—they needed a long runway to take off and land, and they weren’t all that effective for certain purposes. These problems were solved, however, when another powerful flying machine was invented—the helicopter! A helicopter or ‘chopper’ is a type of aircraft that uses rotating wings called rotor blades to fly; they are a critical component of any helicopter’s flight. Helicopters have several advantages over fixed-wing aircraft. First of all, they don't need long runways to operate. They can take off and land pretty much anywhere. It doesn't matter if you’re in the middle of a forest or the backyard of a house. This comes in very handy during military operations or even civilian and medical emergencies. Choppers can also pause mid-flight to load and unload cargo, which is why they’re so widely used during rescue operations around the world. Although helicopters can’t go as fast as airplanes, they are much more maneuverable and offer a great deal of flexibility in terms of the places you can go.",

    "question": "Flexibility is the ability to adjust your thoughts, actions and feelings to the circumstances you find yourself in. Situations change, and so it's important to be able to adjust and behave in the most functional way to achieve your goals. When you're born, your brain is not finished. Infant brains are born under construction. They're waiting for a set of wiring instructions from the world. If you expose your children to a lot of varying experiences then you're basically wiring your child's brain to function in a flexible way and to learn new things when necessary. If your child's experiences are very restricted then your child will have less flexibility to adjust their actions to the situations that they're in. There's a really well-known demonstration of flexibility called the Stroop test. A sequence of words, such as red, green, yellow, blue but written in different colors. When you present people with a whole list of these, you find that it takes people longer to name the color of the ink, when the word is written in a colour that is different to the actual word. The idea behind that is in order to be able to name the colour requires peo ple to switch between different pieces of information in their mind. In simple terms, what happens is that when they scan the word color, the automatic processes of reading the word interfere with the person's ability to state the color out loud.

These changes can happen either through external factors, like radioactivity, or UV and x-rays, or through internal factors, such as when a cell is dividing and it incorrectly copies the DNA. DNA is the instruction book for how to make various molecular machines—proteins. Proteins make up an important aspect of our cells; they help our cells extract energy from food, do the housekeeping, and even make new proteins. These proteins and their function in the body lead to the traits that make us unique, like eye colour or our blood type. Therefore, when the DNA changes, our proteins might also change, which could lead to a change in a trait. Most of the time, mutations don’t cause a significant change. These are considered neutral mutations. Sometimes, however, mutations can be good or bad. When they are bad, they lead to diseases, like cancer or cystic fibrosis.

In fact, it's made possible by the Sun whose energy is absorbed by trees and plants through photosynthesis and then released when organic matter is burned or decomposes. First, there's plant waste. Wood scraps, sawdust, and crop waste can be collected from farms or manufacturers. The waste is burned to heat water; the hot water creates steam; the pressure of the steam spins a turbine; the turbine powers generator; the generator creates electricity. Simple, really! Next up, animal waste. Also known as the problem of cow poop. The solution: wastes from farm animals can be collected in a large tank called a digester, filled with bacteria that eats the waste and converts it to methane gas. The methane is captured and burned to heat water and create steam. Sound familiar? Second verse, same as the first. This same principle can also be used to capture methane, a potent greenhouse gas with 25 times the heat trapping ability of carbon dioxide from landfills. Once a section of the landfill is closed off, pipes are run from the waste to collect the gas, which can then be burned to make electricity or heat.

The luxury real estate market, which drove the construction of several super slender towers from small parcels of land along Billionaires Row in recent years, has also been cooling off. Those structures only really became financially viable because of the prices they were able to command for their location and park views. You couldn’t let commercial space for anywhere near the same rate.

    "question": "There are 118 species of weaver birds, and most live in sub-Saharan Africa. While some species live on the open savannah and eat mostly seeds, others live in forests and prefer feasting on insects. Researchers looked at studies done on different species of weaver birds to examine the relationships between their diets, habits, and social behavior. They found that seed-eating birds living in the open savannah tended to forage in groups, nest in large colonies, and have multiple mates per breeding season. The insect-eating, forest-dwelling birds, on the other hand, were more likely to forage and nest alone, and have a single mate per season. These divergent social behaviors are likely influenced by their different diets and habitats. Working together makes it easier for birds that eat seeds out on the savannah to find spots with a large supply of seeds. There’s also safety in numbers out on the open savannah, further incentivizing flocking. Their polygamous breeding may be a result of the smaller number of nesting sites in the savannah. By contrast, working together to find food wouldn’t help forest-dwelling, insect-eating weaver birds as much, since insects tend to be more widely dispersed. There are a lot more suitable nesting sites in the forest, so these birds don’t need to live in colonies, and monogamy makes sense for birds with more solitary lives. It seems that birds that eat bugs don’t like to be bugged.",

It's the Earth that rotates on its axis. This movement of the Sun is deeply embedded in our biology. When sunlight enters the eye, it sends signals to a master clock in our brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This internal clock regulates everything, from when we sleep to how we digest a meal. Messing with this finely tuned machine, when we work night shifts or fly across the world, can make us feel pretty rough. Even the bluish light from a mobile phone late at night is enough to disrupt and confuse our internal body clock. Being out of step with the Sun affects our mood and our ability to think clearly. And there's evidence that this kind of disruption can lead to higher rates of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.

It is very unfortunate that many of the Native Americans are living under poor conditions throughout the country. In the cases of native Alaskans, even virtually entire villages are suffering from a lack of mental and emotional well-being, which includes continuing poor physical and mental health. Alcohol abuse, domestic violence, homicides, and suicides are frequent among them, which of course, lead to families falling apart. It is tragic to see that many children are abused and not educated properly. As a matter of fact, the children themselves are abusing alcohol and other chemicals, and the rate is increasing over the time. Since parents are suffering from mental illnesses and alcohol abuse, they can't take care of their children, so many children are being taken care of by others or simply neglected. Therefore, we can conclude that Alaskan natives are losing hold of their communities, cultural identities, and most importantly, their childhoods. So you can see how serious the issue is. Plus, rather than making a living for themselves, they are depending on public services and subsidies. They have lost control of and responsibility for their economy and governing institutions.",

    "question": "Human caused global climate change is our most important environmental problem. To help formulate policies to address this crisis, climate scientists are trying to better understand what sorts of human activities cause the production and release of climate warming greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the air. The researchers identified several major categories of emission sources. The first, and largest source globally, has to do with agriculture and changes in land use, such as clearing of forests for more agricultural land. The highest emissions per person from this source are in the developed countries. Meat production is an especially big problem. It's extremely inefficient, requiring much more land to grow animal feed than is used to grow plant foods. One third of all human related methane emissions come from the digestive tracts of cows. Energy consumption involved in producing, packaging, and transporting foods is another big source of emissions. Industries also produce greenhouse gases when they make chemicals used in agriculture, and materials used to package foods. These sources are more important for developed countries, such as the United States. Finally, food waste is a surprisingly large emissions source. Uneaten food goes into landfills, where it produces methane, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases when it decomposes. In the United States, more than a third of all food produced is never eaten, producing emissions all through the food production process, only to rot in a landfill.",

While automation has already entered construction in a number of ways, taking it much further could be truly transformational - filling the gaps where skilled labour cannot be found, freeing-up others to focus on more important work and improving efficiency while raising quality. At the design stage, architects and engineers are already using modelling tools that automate work which would traditionally have been done manually. Some are now using “predictive design” software - where artificial intelligence (AI) designs buildings and infrastructure compliant with regulations and best practice. While the cultural importance of architecture means that the design process is unlikely to ever be fully automated, AI could soon play a major role in optimizing designs - drawing in best practice from learning across thousands of projects.

And the reason for that is if your blood calcium level falls below about 9 milligrams per 100 milliliters, then you're longing to be in a big trouble, and die rather quickly. And that's because blood calcium is important for muscle contraction and nerve transmission.

More than one in three US adults sleep fewer than seven hours per night, the minimum recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. In 2020 a group of health researchers published a review summarizing data from many studies showing a relationship between wealth inequality and racial inequality and sleep problems in United States residents. Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that people with lower income, and racial and ethnic minorities get less sleep. More than thirty-three percent of those living in households with incomes below the poverty level chronically get fewer than seven hours of sleep per night. This sleep gap is due to a complex system of disadvantages. People who work multiple jobs are sixty-one percent more likely to sleep fewer than six hours on a weeknight because of the time spent at work and commuting between jobs. High housing prices in urban centers push lower income people farther out from those centers, forcing them to spend more time commuting to work. The stresses of food insecurity, discrimination, and unfavorable neighborhood characteristics play a role too. The researchers argue that sleep health is not simply a matter of individual choice, but involves multiple levels of influence, from interpersonal factors, to community influences, to the broader society.",

Social media can give people insights into destination countries that may not have otherwise been on their radar. Social media could also make leaving home feel marginally easier, since it’s a way to maintain contact with family across borders.

The internet might contribute to economic growth and job creation in a country, decreasing people’s desire to migrate in search of a better economic situation. Or it could enable more remote work, making it unnecessary to physically leave to find a better job. To find out exactly how the internet affected migration, researchers looked at data from the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union, the Global Peace Index, the Arab Barometer, and the Gallup World Poll to track internet usage and migration patterns. The data showed positive associations between people’s access to the internet and their willingness and actual decisions to migrate.

First of all, physicians should prescribe the drug only when appropriate, only in the correct amount and only for the correct duration. Also, the physician must stress to the patient that the full course of the drug must be taken. This is recommended even if symptoms resolved before the end of the prescription and parents of children on antibiotics need to ensure they complete their course as well.”",

    "question": "Ever wonder how a money changer machine knows if you've given it a one, a five or a ten dollar bill? When a bill is inserted into a money changer machine, it disrupts a light beam from within the machine. This action triggers the motor to pull the bill into the money changer. The machine then begins a process by which it first makes sure the bill is actual currency and then determines the denomination of the bill. With a computer chip and measuring devices, the money changer checks the length, width and thickness of the bill. If the bill is not the exact length and thickness it should be, the changer will reject it and refuse to give you any change. The sensors that evaluate the bill are so sensitive that even an old, wrinkled bill usually will not pass this authenticity test because it will not measure precisely the same as a crisp, new bill. After the machine measures the bill's width, length and thickness, it optically scans the bill to determine if it is a one, five, or ten dollar bill. The machine makes this decision by “reading” how much ink is in different places on the bill. The U.S. treasury department uses specially manufactured ink that has unique magnetic properties. The machine's optical scanner measures this magnetic ink. And because a one dollar bill has a different ink pattern than a five or ten dollar bill, the computer inside the machine is able to differentiate between these denominations with a quick scan.",

Even installing solar systems will not significantly counter the heavy energy load. There are, however, some buildings that strike a balance, or even tip the scales the other way! These are called zero energy buildings. They manage this feat by being extremely energy efficient - saving 50% - 70% more energy than typical buildings! In these ultra-high performance buildings, the amount of energy used can be completely offset by renewable energy produced on or around the building. When conditions are not suitable for energy generation, the building will draw energy from the electrical grid to meet its needs. When conditions improve, the onsite renewable energy systems will cover the building's energy need and send excess energy back into the grid to make up the balance. Over the course of a year, the building gives back as much energy as it takes.

    "question": "The preservation of embryos and juveniles is a rate occurrence in the fossil record. The tiny, delicate skeletons are usually scattered by scavengers or destroyed by weathering before they can be fossilized. Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did terrestrial creatures because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack of swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils. The deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of preservation is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved embryos. Ichthyosaurs with embryos have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of ichthyosaurs repeatedly over time. The embryos are quite advanced in their physical development; their paddles, for example, are already well formed. One specimen is even preserved in the birth canal. In addition, the shale contains the remains of many newborns that are between 20 and 30 inches long. Why are there so many pregnant females and young at Holzmaden when they are so rare elsewhere? The quality of preservation is almost unmatched and quarry operations have been carried out carefully with an awareness of the value of the fossils. But these factors do not account for the interesting question of how there came to be such a concentration of pregnant ichthyosaurs in a particular place very close to their time of giving birth.",

Only in humans do these sounds represent objects and events. Keep in mind that most animals can only repeat their limited utterances over and over again, while humans can say things that have never been said before. Today I want to focus on human language and how it developed. I doubt you'll be surprised when I say that the evolution of language was slow and laborious. There's some reliable evidence that language began with early humans a million and a half years ago. Through the study of the size and shape of brain fossils, scientists have determined that early human brains, like modern brains, had a left hemisphere slightly larger than the right hemisphere. We know that in modern humans, the left hemisphere's the seat of language. We also know that early human brains had a well-developed frontal section, known as Broca's area, which coordinates the muscles of the mouth and throat. It's clear, then, that early humans had a speech apparatus. They could produce any sound that we can. What we don't know is whether early humans used what they had. Since scholars know virtually nothing about prehistoric speech patterns, all they can do is speculate about how language actually originated.

Now there are a lot of different areas of technology involved in water recycling, and we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewerage. What about in the home at the moment; what sort of technology is being utilized in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well very little on average. Typically in a modern home, we turn on the tap, we take a glass of water, we probably in turning on that tap flush ten glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things, and there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a wastewater treatment plant.

Are you saying that such a thing no longer exists and, if so, what are some of the reasons for this, and how important is loyalty to the smooth and successful running of a company such as yours? Well, I do think it's important, but I also realize that we can't go back to the old-fashioned sense of loyalty where an employee would spend his whole working life with one company or business. Our grandparents', even our parents', generation expected long-term employment, and their loyalty was rewarded with health care and a pension. This is no longer the case. Many companies are no longer willing, or perhaps even able, to provide such a financial package. Besides, to a younger generation, sticking at the same job all your life isn't a very exciting or inspiring prospect. Some reasons for this might be the shortening of contracts, outsourcing, automation, and people holding down more than one job. In other words, we've all had to adapt to the realities of a rapidly changing, fast-paced economy. However, all this is not to say that loyalty is dead, rather it has changed emphasis. Today, it is more about trust, and that employee will promise to bring his skills and engage full in his work for as long as she or he is there.

    "question": "As long as industrialized nations consume energy and developing countries increase their fossil fuel consumption the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to rise. Researchers predict that temperatures will increase about 2 to10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. What's less certain is what rising temperatures mean for the planet. Some climate models predict subtle changes. Others forecast rising sea levels which could flood coastal areas around the world. Weather patterns could change, making hurricanes more frequent. Severe droughts could become more common in warm areas and species unable to adapt to the changing conditions would face extinction. Although much remains to be learned about global warming, many organizations advocate cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impact of global warming. Consumers can help. By saving energy around the house, switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs and driving fewer miles in the car each week. These simple changes may help keep the Earth cooler in the future.",

Now there has been some disagreement regarding the extent to which human activity can be blamed for climate change but I want to argue that there is evidence which clearly demonstrates that our own actions really are causing a genuine threat. The available evidence seems to indicate fairly conclusively that land and sea temperatures started to increase around 200 years ago. So, what's the significance of this! Well, 200 years ago roughly coincides with the beginning of the industrial revolution in the northern hemisphere. In other words, this was when our production of harmful gases really got going as a result of increased industrialization. Since that time our production of gases has accelerated due to the fact that not only has industry grown in size but it has also now spread to the southern hemisphere, indeed, most parts of the world. So, in the last 200 years, as industry has grown we can see a gradual rise in the temperatures which, to my mind is sufficient proof of the damaging effect of our actions and needless to say it's an issue which we need to address.",

We have had 15 years more or less of an uninterrupted economic growth during which average earning has been raised by close to 90 percent. While over the course of that period, the standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved. That meant that the amount which a typical home buying household can afford to borrow under rules which aren’t strictly applied as they used to be had more than doubled. Over the same period, rising immigration in falling average household size has meant that the number of households looking for accommodation has risen by about one and a half million. That’s around 200 thousand more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So you have had a substantial increase in the purchasing power of households.

    "question": "In the 1940s, the historically questionable Austrian ethologist named Konrad Lorenz set out to expose the mystery of cuteness. He looked at babies from all over the animal kingdom, and came to one conclusion - the Kindchenschema or \"baby schema\". According to Lorenz, there are a set of features that our brains read as CUTE! These include a large, rounded head, a big forehead, large eyes, chubby cheeks, a rounded body, and soft, elastic skin. Evolutionary biologists working on Lorenz's 'baby schema' thought that these \"cute\" traits and our response to seeing cute babies might have an evolutionary purpose. To see whether the 'baby schema' was really necessary to make something cute, in 2009, a group of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania showed 122 undergraduates pictures of babies and then asked them to rate the cuteness of the babies and how motivated the students would be to care for the baby. The researchers manipulated the baby faces so that some followed the 'baby schema' more closely than others. They found that those baby's faces that MATCHED the schema were rated as cuter than those who didn't. Furthermore, the subjects were more inclined to care for infants that were rated as cuter. Our need to care for our cute infants gives them a better chance of surviving to a reproducible age. Without adults caring for infants, especially in those species whose infants take longer to become self-sufficient, such as human beings, the survival chances of the species would be bleak.",

A similar phenomenon has also occurred in other parts of the animal kingdom. The African grass mouse is a good example. Most mice are nocturnal, but the African grass mouse is active during daylight hours. This means that it spends its days searching for food in the semidry bush and scrub habitats of eastern and southern Africa. Its fur is striped, like a chipmunk’s, which helps it blend in with its environment. Because it spends a lot of time in the intense tropical sun, the grass mouse has also evolved two separate safeguards against the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation. First, like the populations of humans in this region of the world, the skin of the grass mouse contains lots of melanin, or dark pigment. Second, and quite unusual, this mouse has a layer of melanin-pigmented tissue between its skull and skin. This unique “cap ” provides an extra measure of protection for the grass mouse and three other types of African mouse-like rodents that are active during the day.

However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free world, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour.Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential under standing of history would concur with Churchill's self--understanding. Considered old--fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united world, beginning with a union of the English--speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures.

So for someone who's ill, for a patient in a hospital, does a virtual view of a garden have the same impact as a real one? Does it have the same beneficial effects when you look at it? Because that would be good. Well, um, if you test this out, if you put a group of people in a room with a real view and another group of people in a room with a virtual view - an unreal view - you can see what happens when they get stressed. If you give both groups a task that is slightly stressful and increases their heart rate and, um, what you'll find is that the people who have the real garden scene outside their window to look at - their heart rate goes back to normal more quickly than those of the people in the other group who only have a virtual view to look at. So, yes, there is a difference - people's recovery from stress is faster in the room with the real view.",

    "question": "The drastic slowdown in the real estate market in the United States is being felt around the world. At the heart of this economic downturn is the subprime crisis facing many American home owners. The subprime crisis refers to the recent avalanche of homeowners defaulting on their home loans. When someone defaults on a loan, they essentially stop repaying the loan and give up trying to meet the initial repayment plan. Many of these home owners had subprime loans. These are loans that require little money up front and often start off with affordable payments. However, these subprime loans often have adjustable interest rates, which mean that over time, the interest rate for the loans can drastically go up. Higher interest rates mean higher monthly payments. As a result, homeowners with subprime loans found themselves with rising home payments they could not afford. In many cases, the home loan payments became so large that the homeowners could not meet the monthly payments, and as a result, they had to turn their home over to the bank they borrowed money from. The subprime home loan collapse has not only hit home owners. Many investment banks that had invested in these loans by financing the loan market have been hit hard as well, as they have not been able to collect on their initial investment.",

    "question": "Try telling someone who has just fallen on a patch of ice that ice is not slippery, and they'll think you're crazy. But, in fact, ice itself isn't slippery because it is a solid. One quality of solids is that when two solids are together, there is friction between them and that will keep them from slipping. So how can your shoes slip on ice? The answer lies in two peculiar properties of ice. The first is that as water freezes, its molecules move farther apart. The molecules of most substances move closer together as they freeze, making them shrink at lower temperatures. But water molecules move farther apart at temperatures below 39 degrees Fahrenheit, making water expand as it freezes. That is why frozen water pipes burst, and a tray of ice cubes will freeze over its top if you fill it too full. The second peculiar property of ice is directly linked to its first peculiarity. When subjected to pressure, ice melts. Remember that the molecules in ice are farther apart than the molecules in water; therefore ice molecules are vulnerable to pressure which pushes them closer together, causing the ice to change into water. So when you step on a patch of ice, you exert pressure on the ice, which causes its molecules to move closer together. That makes them revert to their more dense state, which is water. If you slip on a patch of ice, then, you in fact are slipping on a thin layer of water that the pressure from your weight has created. And, unlike solid ice, water, as a liquid , is quite slippery.",

In fact, a typical astronomer spends most of his or her time analyzing data and may only be at the telescope a few weeks of the year. Some astronomers work on purely theoretical problems and never use a telescope at all. You might not know how rarely images are viewed directly through telescopes. The most common way to observe the skies is to photograph them. The process is very simple. First, a photographic plate is coated with a light-sensitive material. The plate is positioned so that the image received by the telescope is recorded on it. Then the image can be developed, enlarged, and published so that many people can study it. Because most astronomical objects are very remote, the light we receive from them is rather feeble. But by using a telescope as a camera, long time exposures can be made.

    "question": "The concept of self-domestication in animals, particularly dogs, is quite intriguing. One prominent theory suggests that dogs began their domestication journey by scavenging around human settlements, especially garbage dumps. This theory posits that less aggressive wolves were more successful at scavenging near humans, leading to a natural selection process favoring those with friendlier and more cooperative traits. However, some researchers argue against this \"dump theory\". They suggest that the domestication of dogs was more complex and involved active cooperation and emotional bonds between humans and wolves long before the existence of human waste dumps. This perspective highlights the psychological and neurobiological similarities between humans and dogs that facilitated their close relationship. Overall, the self-domestication hypothesis emphasizes that the evolution of dogs from wolves was likely driven by a combination of factors, including reduced aggression and increased sociability.",

One of them, and perhaps this is the most important one, is that we need to enable citizens, ordinary people, to take more responsibility. As co-authors of their civic lives, they need to be able to determine what kinds of services and facilities they need, and also, think about how they can contribute in those areas, how they can become involved. A second area we looked at was how to create a public service, and public servants who are able to actually support citizens in what they want and need. Now this should perhaps happen in a more down-to-earth and less bureaucratic way than we've seen in the past. I'm talking about moving towards a more customer-directed approach across the board. Finally, we need to look at the relationships between national government, local government, and citizens, because that has not been functioning as it should. We've had over-directive centralism, and a kind of mistrust has emerged between national and local bodies - and it's the citizens who bear the brunt of this.",

    "question": "And just as you take care of your body in extreme temperatures, railroads have to watch out for overheating, too. Railways lay tracks at something called \"the neutral temperature,\" representing the middle temperatures of the local environment. For instance, the neutral temperature is lower in Alaska than in Florida. In each case, the steel rails can tolerate both chilly winter nights and sweltering summer afternoons. But steel, just like your own body, doesn't like extreme weather. When tracks endure excessive heat, the steel expands. Eventually, the stress of this expansion can cause the tracks to buckle, or suddenly bend to the side. In locomotive lingo, this is called a \"sun kink.\" Some sun kinks are gentle curves only a few feet long. But others might be very sharp and stretch for yards. From an aerial view, it can look as if a giant reached down and bent the once-straight rails into a capital S, or a squiggly line. Unfortunately, these can cause trains to derail. To prevent derailments, railroad workers perform \"heat patrols,\" where they walk the tracks and keep an eye out for sun kinks. If necessary, they may try to reduce the stress in rails by cutting out a section to prevent them from buckling. If a sun kink does occur, the workers cut out the bent track and put it back in the proper position, or lay new rails as replacements.",

Empathy, often described as the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, is a fundamental human trait. It enables us to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and experiences, bridging gaps created by differences in culture, belief, or ideology. Moreover, empathy plays a pivotal role in resolving conflicts. When individuals and groups genuinely empathize with each other's perspectives, they are more likely to find common ground and work towards peaceful solutions. In a world rife with division, empathy is a powerful tool for promoting harmony and cooperation. Furthermore, empathy fuels positive social change. It drives individuals and communities to advocate for justice, equality, and humanitarian causes. Empathetic leaders and activists inspire others to join in the pursuit of a better, more compassionate world. In conclusion, empathy is a powerful force for bridging divides, resolving conflicts, and driving positive change.

It was formed millions of years ago, when dead organisms sunk to the bottom of the ocean and were buried under deposits of sedimentary rock.

The rocks have tiny spaces called pores that allow them to hold water natural gas and sometimes oil. The natural gas is trapped underground by impermeable rock, called a cap rock, and stays there until it is extracted. Natural gas can be categorized as dry or wet. Dry gas is essentially gas that contains mostly methane; wet gas, on the other hand, contains compounds, such as ethane and butane, in addition to methane. These natural gas liquids, or NGLs for short, can be separated and sold individually for various uses, such as in refrigerants and to produce products like plastics. Conventional natural gas can be extracted for drilling wells; unconventional forms of natural gas, like shale gas, tight gas, sour gas, and coal bed methane, has specific extraction techniques.

    "question": "The ‘less space = more traffic' theory, known as level of service, was once the established rule of traffic engineering, but it has long been discredited. To show how traffic really works, we need to look at a different supply and demand concept, called induced demand, which simply means the more you increase the supply of something, in this instance roads, the more people use it. This is because when you expand a road, travelling by car becomes quicker and easier in the short term. And this makes travelling by car more attractive, and so more people are more likely to use their cars than usual. More car trips = more cars on the road, and all that extra space quickly disappears. Now there is a limit to all of this. If you make a 10-lane motorway into 100 lanes, you could travel without seeing another car for miles. But we're not talking about a mathematical principal, we're talking about human behavior, which is often influenced by a whole host of different factors. Something which the level of service argument cannot account for. So what impact does the introduction of new bike lanes have? Well the induced demand effect also works in reverse, which means when you reduce road capacity, by introducing new bike lanes for instance, again there is an immediate impact, but this time car travel becomes slower and more congested in the short term. This then discourages road use and as a result congestion will largely go back to similar levels as it was before and in some cases go down. It's called traffic evaporation.",

    "question": "But what exactly is evolution and how does it work? Evolution “is the net change in organisms or a population over the span of many generations.” We can break this definition into two parts - the net change in organisms or a population, and one that occurs over the span of many generations. The first part reveals what and where these “changes” happen - the mechanisms of evolution like natural selection. The second part tells us two things - the time it takes for organisms to change, and, less obviously, that the process involves reproduction, DNA, heritability, and change. The core of evolution is the change in organisms, and the first place to investigate this change is in the DNA. DNA is the blueprint of all life. Its sequence is composed of four letters that bond in specific ways: A to T and C to G. Small sections of the DNA sequence, called genes, code for certain traits like eye color or blood group. Genes can come in a variety of “flavors”, meaning that the gene for eye color can code for blue eyes, or brown eyes, or even green eyes!

We may even blame fat people themselves for the discrimination they face because, after all, if we don’t like it, we should just lose weight. Easy! This anti-fat bias has become so integral, so ingrained to how we value ourselves and each other that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size and where that disdain comes from.

A total eclipse can only be seen if you're standing within the umbral shadow. That's why the imaginary line created by this shadow as it races across Earth is known as the path of totality. People within the penumbral shadow see only a partial eclipse, the second type. From this view, outside the path of totality, the moon passes in front of the sun off-center, never fully covering its surface. Third, an annular eclipse, occurs when the moon passes directly in front of the sun. However, unlike a total eclipse, the moon appears too small to fully cover the sun. The moon's orbit is elliptical, so sometimes it's closer to Earth and sometimes it's farther away. Last, a hybrid eclipse, is when the moon's position between the Earth and sun is so finely balanced that the curvature of the Earth plays a role. The moon will be farther away from some parts of Earth along the eclipse's path, resulting in an annular eclipse.

Research suggests that over thousands of years, some dogs got bigger due to the nature of their job: as important managers of livestock, early canines doubled in size to protect their flocks from predators. A study of ancient canine bone fragments and teeth in Croatia determined that 8,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers immigrated to the area with their furry friends in tow. This early breed weighed a little over 30 pounds. Two millennia later, at the start of the Bronze Age, dogs averaged about 40 pounds. By the Roman period, 2,000 years ago, dogs clocked in at more than 50 pounds. In other words, dogs went from the size of a large beagle to the size of a husky! That’s some major growth in just 6,000 years. The increased size wasn’t happenstance. Villages were becoming bigger, needing more land to grow crops. This meant livestock were pastured further from villages, often in the mountains. So, dogs’ job responsibilities expanded as well: they not only had to travel long distances, they had to scare off hungry bears and wolves.

Major types include stratovolcanoes, which often appear as tall steep mountains, shield volcanoes, which are flatter and dome-shaped, calderas, which are large depressions in the ground, and mid-ocean ridges, which are underwater chains of volcanic mountains. No matter their shape or size, all volcanoes emit gas and molten rock. The Journey of these emissions begins deep underground in the Earth's core. The core, which can burn as hot as the surface of the Sun, transfers its heat to the surrounding Rocky mantle.

And you know, despite your best efforts, it might be really tough to feel productive these days. Living and working in this coronavirus environment means finding new ways of defining, redefining productivity and measuring your success. That might mean that you get through zoom call without your dog interrupting you, or that you successfully reconnect with your team members, just to check in and see how they're doing. Take a break to get a perspective. Research tells us that we do need to step away and can't be constantly working. When we can press the reset button by pulling away and pausing, that allows us to access the one thing that we can control, which is our perspective. Remember to cut yourself in your brain some slack. So during periods of ongoing stress, our brain is actually wired to kind of shut down that logical thought process, and move into reactive mode, which is never a great idea. So just be kind to yourself. Remember it's your neurobiology. Be kind yourself and give yourself a break.",

    "question": "In The Origin of Species, Darwin provided abundant evidence that life on Earth has evolved over time, and he proposed natural selection as the primary mechanism for that change. He observed that individuals differ in their inherited traits and that selection acts on such differences, leading to evolutionary change. Although Darwin realized that variation in heritable traits is a prerequisite for evolution , he did not know precisely how organisms pass heritable traits to their offspring. Just a few years after Darwin published The Origin of Species, Gregor Mendel wrote a groundbreaking paper on inheritance in pea plants. In that paper, Mendel proposed a model of inheritance in which organisms transmit discrete heritable units (now called genes) to their offspring. Although Darwin did not know about genes, Mendel’s paper set the stage for understanding the genetic differences on which evolution is based.",

And I think this change may be as important for businesses as the change to democracy has been for governments. The reason I think that's happening is because it's now possible for the first time in human history to have the economic benefits of very large organizations. Things like economies of scale and knowledge and at the same time to have the human benefits of small organizations. Things like freedom, flexibility, creativity, and motivation. The reason I think that's possible is because Information Technology has now reduced the cost of communication to such a low level that it's now possible for huge numbers of people even in very large organizations to have enough information to make sensible decisions for themselves instead of just following orders from someone above them who supposedly knows more than they do in a management hierarchy.",

    "question": "Dyslexia is a learning disorder. The reader has difficulty linking a language’s proper speech sounds to letters and words. The brain struggles to learn how to automatically connect a word’s pronunciation with what it looks like on the page. While scientists are still researching dyslexia’s exact causes, the general agreement is that a dyslexic brain has trouble combining visual and sensory information. Consider the process that our brain has to go through to read: break down the visual word into its individual letters, convert those letters to sounds, then blend the sounds to create the whole spoken word. This process of breaking down and blending can take a long time for someone with dyslexia. But if you’re dyslexic in English, you might not have that trouble in Chinese. That’s because while English is an alphabetic language, using letters as the building blocks of words, Chinese is a logographic language. A logographic language uses written characters, instead of a combination of letters, to represent words. In order to know how a Chinese character is pronounced and what it means, you have to memorize the image of that character. What effect does this have on dyslexia? In English, dyslexic children often struggle with the phonics approach to reading, whereas their ability to read logographically may well be unimpaired. Since logographic Chinese requires its readers to know the whole word at once, the difficulties for a dyslexic English speaker might not be as severe if they try to read in Chinese.",

    "question": "A fast radio burst is very much like what it sounds. It’s a very fast burst of radio waves. It comes from outer space, a long way away. And by fast, I mean really fast. So it starts and stops in about a thousandth of a second, so you click your fingers, and it’s finished. Fast radio bursts are a real mystery. We don’t exactly understand where they com from, or what actually makes them. And there’s a lot of open questions that we really don’t have an answer for. There are probably more theories about what makes fast radio bursts, than there actual detections of these things. So since 2007 we’ve only had 20, but there are probably 30 or 40 different theories on what makes them. The most interesting thing about this burst is the fact that we found it with the Australian square kilometre ray path finder. So that is, it wasn’t really obvious that we would be able to do this, as well as we ended up being able to do it. So this telescope is really a fantastic telescope. In fact it’s probably the best telescope on the planet at the moment for finding these bursts. So whereas in the past it’s taken ten years to find twenty bursts, once we’re really going with this new instrument, we’ll able to find them much more quickly. One or two every week.

    "question": "For adolescent boys, a changing voice that cracks in the middle of a sentence can be a great embarrassment. Though embarrassing, a cracking voice is a natural part of adolescent development. As a boy goes through adolescence, his secondary sex characteristics develop. One of these characteristics is the rapid growth of the larynx and vocal cords. A boy's voice deepens as his larynx develops because the bigger the vocal cords, the deeper the voice. In fact, vocal cords are similar to other musical instruments in this regard. The longer the harp string, for instance, the lower the note it plays. Similarly, if you are blowing into a bottle to create a certain pitch, the larger the bottle, the lower the pitch. When it comes to voices, the bigger the vocal cords, the lower they resonate, and the deeper the voice will be. But why does a boy's changing voice break and crack? For the same reason, growing adolescents are often gangly and awkward. Because the brain is becoming accustomed to working with bigger body parts. Even for an adult, a consistent and even voice depends on the brain's ability to constantly monitor the sounds that come from the voice. The brain can do this quite easily under normal circumstances. But, when a boy's vocal cords enlarge, the brain must relearn how to monitor and control the voice. A cracking voice is proof that an adolescent boy's brain hasn't become completely proficient at coordinating its careful monitoring of the sounds coming from the vocal cords.",

    "question": "People these days increasingly complain of suffering from allergies - to pollen, to cats, to dust, to certain foods like peanuts or shellfish, for example. But what exactly are allergies and why do we develop them! Well. An allergy is the body reacting to something that is trying to harm it. Sometimes the reaction is mild - sneezing or a rash, perhaps - but in extreme cases it can be life-threatening. In an allergic reaction the body is stimulated to produce histamines, which help to get rid of what is harmful. So, your eyes and nose may stream as a way of losing irritating particles or your skin may itch in order to make you scratch it and so remove any harmful parasites. In some societies these days allergic reactions occur without the person being in a harmful situation. However, in situations where, say, hygiene is less developed, then the body's immune system spends its early years fighting off genuine problems and so does not tend to over-react to harmless irritants at a later stage. So, how to deal with an allergy? The first step has to be to ascertain what triggers the allergic reaction and then to avoid contact with that allergen as far as is possible. If avoidance is impossible, anti-histamines can be prescribed to minimize the symptoms experienced by the sufferer.",

A flash point is the temperature at which the fumes from a liquid can be ignited with a spark, but people who have never taken a chemistry course need to be concerned with flash points as well. For example, the gasoline you put into your car has a flash point of minus forty-five degrees Fahrenheit. So, unless you live in a climate where the temperature stays below minus forty-five degrees, the fumes from gasoline can ignite from a nearby spark. And that's why most gas stations have warning signs posted about not smoking while you fill up your tank. Olive oil has a flash point of 437 degrees Fahrenheit. That means if you could heat olive oil to 437 degrees, it would give off a vapor that could ignite if a lit match passed through it. Cod liver oil has a flash point of 412 degrees Fahrenheit and formaldehyde has a flash point of 122 degrees. Most flash points are inconsequential to the lay person because they occur at such high temperatures. But some, like kerosene, with a flash point of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, can be cause for concern on a hot day.

    "question": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Many people are now interested in the transformative influence of compassion and its role in fostering unity and empathy in an increasingly divided world. Compassion, at its core, is the ability to understand and empathize with the suffering of others. It promotes kindness, tolerance, and a sense of shared humanity, transcending barriers of nationality, religion, and culture. Moreover, compassion drives positive social change. It motivates individuals and communities to take action to alleviate suffering and address social injustices. Compassionate acts, whether through volunteer work, charitable donations, or advocacy, have the potential to create a more equitable and just society. Furthermore, compassion enhances personal well-being. Studies have shown that practicing compassion can reduce stress, improve mental health, and foster a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It strengthens social bonds and contributes to a sense of belonging and interconnectedness. In conclusion, compassion is a powerful force for bridging divides, driving positive change, and promoting personal well-being. It is a quality that we should nurture and encourage in ourselves and our communities, as it holds the key to a more harmonious and empathetic world.",

    "question": "So, why do humans feel awkwardness? According to Ty Tashiro, author of the appropriately-titled book ‘Awkward’, this is part of human evolution. In hunter-gatherer times, sticking with social norms, like saying thank you when someone gives you something, or waiting your turn for food, was a way to keep tight-knit groups together and keep out anyone who might be a threat. Today, we’re still sensitive to tiny, even silly social customs like responding to “how are you” with “fine” as a sign of mutual respect. When you deviate from those norms, it’s awkward. And for some people, these social graces just don’t come naturally. Take eye contact, for example. Studies say the right amount of eye contact during conversations is about 3.3 seconds. But awkward people don’t instinctively do that. But when we don’t look people in the eyes, it makes them feel socially ostracized. According to Tashiro’s work, awkward people tend to look at other parts of the face, like the chin or the ear, more than the eyes. Therefore, they might end up alienating the person they’re talking to, and missing out on important information about how that person might be feeling. The good news is that if your brain isn’t great at social cues, it might be good at other stuff instead. Research shows that many autistic people are amazing at memory, pattern recognition and problem solving.",

Ever since the age of discoveries in the Renaissance, Europeans have been interested in reports of life in faraway places. Of all the places in which Europeans were interested, America has received more attention than others for a variety of reasons, the most important of which is that many Europeans themselves emigrated there. The report about America from the person who has been there is a literary genre that Europeans have devoured. As Europeans watched the United States grow from a British colony to one of the dominant nations of the world, a pattern of conversation developed among them about the meaning of this emerging Colossus of the New World. There emerged a question, apdy stated by Richard Rose: Is America inevitable or inimitable? The question is easier to ask than to answer and both sides of the question are amply represented in American and European writing about America. The one stresses the uniqueness of America, that no nation or people can be compared with the experience of Americans.

We're giving them fewer opportunities for the quiet contemplation they need in order to produce the best work and be their best selves.

This year record temperatures come amid soaring inflation and rising prices, and the hot weather is already hurting farmers. Because of the heat wave, our crops have suffered due to the sudden rise in temperature. The water table has dropped. The great heat has decimated our crop yield by half. That is why new Delhi has banned wheat exports. It wants to put India's own food security first amid frequent supply chain disruptions and rising food prices, but the government has stopped short of an outright ban. India plans to honor shipment agreements inked before the ban, and they will continue to export to food deficit countries, including Egypt and Bangladesh. But that doesn't supply much relief for major wheat importers. On Monday, wheat prices soared to a record high following the Indian government's announcement.

A water molecule is made from two very light atoms, Hydrogen and oxygen. And at the temperatures and pressures on the surface of the Earth, rules of chemistry say that water should be a gas. And, unlike any other chemical, when water freezes it expands. And so ice floats on water. Now you see this every day, but take a moment to think about how weird that is. Over time, this odd behavior has been very useful. By insulating the water underneath, floating ice has enabled complex life to survive and evolve on our planet, despite the many ice ages that have frozen the Earth's surface solid. And the strangeness just goes on and on. Did you know that hot water freezes faster than cold? Yes, really. No-one knows why. Water molecules can float upwards, against the force of gravity. That's because they love to stick to each other. They're so good at it that they can actually pull each other up through tiny channels, such as the tiny blood vessels in your body. That's how oxygen and nutrients reach the edges of your brain.

    "question": "When thinking of predatory animals such as foxes, most would probably imagine a vicious carnivore with razor sharp teeth, but what if I told you that a certain fox species munches on Christmas beetles and berries? In its natural habitat, the European red fox has been known to be an expert hunter that feasts mostly on small animals such as rabbits and birds; but a study suggests that their diet may not always be so simple. In Queensland, Australia where the European red fox is invasive, it has had to adapt to an environment that is constantly changing due to local urbanization and the extinctions of many native species. Because of this, foxes may no longer have access to what they would have eaten in their traditional dietary niches. Curious as to what they would find, a group of scientists studied the diet of European red foxes over the course of four years. This study found that in their invaded habitat, the diet of European red foxes directly reflects what can be found in their environment. Without abundant access to prey, foxes act more akin to scavenging foragers that will munch on everything from plants to insects such as Christmas beetles, and even decaying bird and fish remains. The expansiveness of their dietary niche reflects both the foxes’ opportunistic foraging habits as well as the constantly changing environment in which they live.",

Much of this organizing and activism took place in the Southern part of the United States; however, people from all over the country—of all races and religions—joined activists to proclaim their support and commitment to freedom and equality.

They came to have their voices heard and listen to speeches by many civil rights leaders, especially Martin Luther King, Jr., who delivered what would become one of the most influential speeches in history. In the aftermath of World War II, African American civil rights efforts were hampered by ideological splits. The Southern system of white supremacy was accompanied by the expansion of European and American imperial control over nonwhite people in Africa and Asia as well as in island countries of the Pacific and Caribbean regions.

There is this notion that in order to have progress and development in cities, you need people. If everybody is busy growing crops, growing food that exists, you can't also have people going into the city. You need to increase productivity in the countryside.

And I think the real important words there is \"if\" because it turns out that in certain climates which aren't near the equator, there's a big question as to whether or not you do get adequate sunshine. So vitamin D really isn't actually a vitamin. It's a pro-hormone. When human beings evolve, we evolved in tropical climates and ran around naked with plenty of skin exposure to sunlight and so there was no dietary need for vitamin D at all. As humans migrated away from equatorial regions, they actually created a need for vitamin D in food because the sunlight wasn't adequate, I mean certainly, particularly during the winter months, it wasn't adequate at all.",

Firstly, Vitamin D is known as the \"sunshine vitamin\" as there is no dietary need for it if adequate sunlight is obtained. However, in certain climates far from the equator, there may be a lack of sunshine. Secondly, Vitamin D is actually a pro-hormone and was not originally required in our diet. Therefore, as humans migrated away from equatorial regions, a dietary need for Vitamin D arose. Hence, it is essential to consider the availability of sunlight and potential need for Vitamin D supplementation.",

    "question": "A single workout that you do will immediately increase levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. But these immediate effects are transient, they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime, increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually changes the brain’s anatomy, physiology and function. Let’s start with my favorite brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus — or exercise actually produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus, that actually increase its volume, as well as improve your long-term memory, OK?

    "question": "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. Its diameter currently measures just over 3,000 miles, about the size of the continental United States. Like Earth, Mercury is a terrestrial planet with three main layers, a core, a mantle, and a crust. Only Mercury's crust has no tectonic plates. Also, its iron core is enormous by comparison, making up 85% of its radius, while Earth's inner and outer core account for just 55%. Because of the core's exceptional size, it's had a surprising influence on Mercury's overall size, by causing it to shrink. The hot iron core has slowly cooled and contracted over the planet's 4.5 billion years. In doing so, it pulled Mercury's surface inward, and has caused the planet to shrink radially by more than four miles. This shrinking planet is also the planet closest to the sun, orbiting our solar system's star at an average distance of roughly 36 million miles. Such proximity affects Mercury's atmosphere, or rather, the lack of one. It only has a very thin exosphere, which is traditionally the outermost layer of a planet's atmosphere. This exosphere is made of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, all whipped up from the planet's surface by solar winds.",

This was a handwritten news-sheet posted daily in the Forum at Rome and in other common meeting places around the city. Of course, a lot of the news would be out of date in the sense that, for example, it took a long time for reports of a victory in a distant country to get back to Rome. Nonetheless, a lot of the items included are similar to those found in more modern newspapers: news of battles, as already mentioned, as well as political and military appointments, political events, and even a social diary recording marriages, births, and deaths. One mustn't forget sport - if that is what you'd call it. Just like modern fans of football, sports-minded Romans could keep up with the latest results of the gladiator contests. People who lived in the provinces and wanted to be kept up to date would send scribes to Rome to copy the news and have them send it back by letter. Many of these scribes could make extra money by providing the news to more than one client. Quite a few of them were slaves and would go on to use the extra money earned to buy their freedom.",

    "question": "In today's lecture I'm going to talk about changes in air pollution since the middle of the last century and what has created these changes. So, um — by the 1950s, air pollution was very visible with frequent thick black fogs known as 'smogs' in many large cities around the world. The main source of this pollution was from factories and it caused severe health problems. For example, a particularly severe smog in London in 1952 caused over four thousand deaths. Obviously something had to be done and in 1956 a Clean Air Act was introduced in Britain. This addressed the pollution from factories and the smogs soon disappeared. However, as you know, these days air pollution is still a big issue. The main difference between now and the 1950s is that you can't see it — it's invisible. Also, the main source of pollution now is from cars and lorries, and although these don't produce visible signs, this air pollution is still a significant risk to health. And one of the key factors in the rise of this type of pollution is that we have all become much more vehicle-dependent. There are far more cars and lorries, trains and planes than in the 1950s and this is now the main source of air pollution around the world.",

It's what best-selling author Susan Cain calls “The Extrovert Ideal”. But is this really what we need right now? I'd argue that the crises of our time need a more considered approach. A quieter one. Let's look at the status quo. Extroverts are over-represented in senior leadership positions. One study found an incredible 98% of top executives scoring “very high” or “above average” on the extrovert scale. But people aren't on the whole satisfied with their leaders. Could there be a connection between the two? There are lots of examples through history of successful leaders who have taken that quieter approach. For example, Rosa Parks, Mahatma Gandhi, or Bill Gates. Research shows that introverts often bring a great deal to the table. They're more likely to listen and process the ideas of their team, and consider those ideas deeply before acting on them. They may be humble and more likely to credit their team for ideas and performance.

    "question": "A meteor shower occurs when the trail of interplanetary debris, like the one left behind by comets or asteroids, enters the Earth's atmosphere. The interplanetary debris is mostly made up of space rocks, also called meteoroids. As the meteoroids fall toward Earth, they produce drag throughout the rock. This causes the meteoroid to heat up. The streak of intense light we see is the hot air left behind the burning rock. When Earth encounters many meteoroids at once, we call it a meteor shower. Meteor showers are usually named for the constellation in which their radiant appears. The most common and famous meteor showers are Perseus Leonid Geminids and Lyra's. However; it is estimated that there are around 21 meteor showers every year, with most of them occurring between August and December. Meteors enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds ranging from 25,000 miles per hour to 160,000 miles per hour. It's frightening to imagine all that interplanetary debris flying toward us.

    "question": "We all know that outside the world of Sesame Street, big birds can’t talk. However, our own big bird, the five-foot tall Whooping Crane, can communicate in a variety of other ways. Their inability to talk doesn’t mean that the tall white birds are silent. Thanks to specialized looped windpipes, their calls can be heard for miles in their wetland homes. Often, a mated pair will call simultaneously, a behavior known as unison calling. These calls allow the male and female to strengthen their pair bond and tell rival cranes and other potential threats they need to give the pair some space. If an intruder gets close, the cranes may turn to more visual displays. Whooping Cranes’ heads are crowned with a patch of bare red skin. Cranes warn encroaching individuals that they are too close by tilting their heads down to display this patch. They can also direct more blood flow to it, making the red brighter and the patch larger. More visible red means an angrier crane. But not all crane communication is aggressive. Whooping Crane pairs, which mate for life, participate in a spectacular dancing display. They bow to one another, spread their wings, toss bits of grass or sticks above their heads, and jump high into the air. We believe this dance reaffirms their pair bond, which must be strong for the couple to defend a territory and successfully raise chicks.

The most common symptoms of an infection are fever, a dry cough and shortness of breath. Some of these symptoms are very similar to the common cold, the seasonal flu and seasonal allergies, but others, like a runny nose or sneezing, are not.  Covid-19 can survive for a while outside your body, floating in the air, sitting on a surface.

There are lots of variables to this, things like temperature, humidity, even sunlight, can play a role in how long the virus can survive on the outside. There is no vaccine yet for covid-19. Initial trials have just begun, but it may take a year to 18 months before one is available. In the meantime, one of the best defenses is nothing new. Wash your hands. Scrub them with soap and water, front and back, for 20s. And it doesn't matter how hot the water is. Hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol is your 2nd best option after washing.

Well-meaning people sometimes wonder, with considerable hope, if Sigmund Freud has not after all by now been proved ‘wrong’. The tricky and humiliating answer is that no, he never actually will be in the substance of his insight. Freud’s eternal contribution has been to alert us to the many ways in which adult emotional lives sit on top of childhood experiences – and how we are made sick by not knowing our own histories. In a saner world, we would be left in no doubt – and even partially alerted while we were living through them – that our childhoods hold the secrets to our identities. We would know that the one subject we need to excel at above all is one not yet flagged up by the school system the subject called ‘My Childhood’, and the sign that we have graduated in the topic with honours is when at last we can know and think non-defensively about how we are (in small ways and large) a little bit mad, and what exactly in the distant past might have made us so.",

    "question": "A bird strike is an event that involves a collision between a bird and a man-made vehicle, typically an aircraft, while it is in operation. The term bird strike is a dolphin expanded to cover other wildlife strikes, such as those involving bats. In theory, bird strikes can occur during any phase of flight, but they are most likely to occur during the takeoff, initial ascent, approach, and landing phases of the flight. It's relatively uncommon for bird collisions to occur when an airplane is cruising at high altitudes, as birds usually fly at lower levels. Furthermore more than half of such incidents occur during daylight hours, as birds typically fly during the day. Bird strikes are not as uncommon as one might think. More than one hundred ninety-four thousand cases of wildlife strikes were reported from 1990 to 2017 within the US alone. From 1988 to 2017 a total of 263 civilian aircraft were either destroyed or damaged beyond repair due to wildlife strikes around the world. The nature of aircraft damage from bird strikes depends on the size of the airplane in question. Smaller airplanes most likely experience structural damage, such as the penetration of flight deck wind screens or damage to control surfaces. In some cases, especially with choppers and fixed-wing aircraft, windscreen penetration may potentially injure pilots or other people on board, which may lead to a loss of control of the aircraft, which could have disastrous consequences. On the other hand, a large aircraft powered by jet engines usually experience engine malfunction or, in the very worst case, complete engine failure when birds fly into them.",

Most people over 65 had very low incomes and few owned private health insurance of any kind. Congress began a years-long debate on this issue of national health insurance for the elderly. Critics in Congress feared Medicare would lead to substandard and overpriced care, and felt that it should serve only the indigent. They also predicted that, with growing numbers participating, it would eventually bankrupt the federal Treasury. The legislative compromise that became the final Medicare Act — officially known as the “Social Security Amendments of 1965” — was part of President Lyndon Johnson's “Great Society” program. Today it protects more than 40 million Americans from the high cost of hospital care. Much of the program's costs are covered by payroll taxes paid by workers. Yet costs quickly started to exceed expectations, and as Americans' life expectancy increased over the years, the Medicare program became even more expensive. It has become a matter of national debate and a financial issue for every Congress and President since. Today it is still one of the fastest growing items in the federal budget.

    "question": "Host: Family doctors are usually called GPs, or general practitioners. Speaker: My name is Louis Brassy. I'm a so-called general practitioner doctor in the center of London. I'm one of two doctors working in our clinic and between us we have, let's say, 3,500 patients. England still has a system which it's had, really, since the Second World War, where theoretically every patient in England is registered with one family doctor, almost always near where they live. If they're ever sick, if any of the family are sick, they go directly, initially to the family doctor, unless it's an emergency, who, most cases, I think 80% of cases, he can sort out by himself. And about 20% of cases, if they need to see a specialist, he will send them on to whichever specialty is most appropriate. Rather than approaching a specialist directly, anybody who is sick under normal circumstances will go and see his general practitioner, who is qualified at a basic level in all sorts of different illnesses and can provide primary care. First of all, people tend to be registered with their GPs for a long period of time, so after a few years you tend to know the whole family, you tend to know each patient and the context in which they are turning up. You tend to have all the records to hand, you tend to know what illnesses they've had, what it's likely to be and what's in the family generally, which sometimes helps you, rather than somebody who would just turn up to a doctor they've never seen before. No money is exchanged when you go to see a doctor in this country. We never ask for money for general medical services. The government pays us to look after patients using a kind of complex formula, a lot of which depends on how many people are registered with us.",

This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you, you’re not alone. Researchers think about 20% of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn’t necessarily mean you’re bad at math – not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they’re anxious about math because they’re bad at it, but it’s often the other way around. They’re doing poorly in math because they’re anxious about it. Some psychologists think that’s because math anxiety decreases a cognitive resource called working memory. That’s the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information you need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle the math itself. People can suddenly struggle with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, that they’ve otherwise mastered.",

You might think that they were wandering aimlessly — far from it! They actually followed a series of carefully planned moves. Where they moved depended on where food was available—places where plants were ripening or fish were spawning. Now often when these people moved, they carried all their possessions on their backs, but if the journey was long, extra food and tools were sometimes stored in caves or beneath rocks. One of these caves is now an exciting archaeological site. Beyond its small opening is a huge underground grotto. Even though the cave's very large, it was certainly too dark and dusty for the travelers to live in, but it was a great place to hide things, and tremendous amounts of food supplies and artifacts have been found there. The food includes dried fish, seeds, and nuts. The artifacts include stone spear points and knives; the spear points are actually rather small. Here's a picture of some that were found.

But is napping always a good thing? Well, not necessarily. Although we and other scientists have discovered that naps can have benefits for both the brain and for the body, naps can be a double-edged sword. Long naps in the afternoon or in the early evening can just take the edge off your sleepiness. It’s a little bit like snacking before your main meal. So if you are struggling with sleep at night, the best advice is not to nap during the day. Instead, build up all of that healthy sleepiness so that you give yourself the best chance of falling asleep easily and then staying asleep soundly across the night. But if you’re not struggling with sleep and you can nap regularly during the day, the naps of around 20 minutes taken early in the day can be just fine.",

As these effects become increasingly more obvious worldwide, so commercial interests, groups of concerned individuals and national governments have been gripped by amounts of mass panic and what to do about it. To many, Paul Ehrlich’s Malthusian \"Population Bomb\" of 1968 appears about to explode in the world’s face in an indirect version of his millenarian vision of population growth which outpaces agricultural production capacity - with predictably catastrophic results for humanity. And his three-part crisis scenario does indeed seem now to be present: a rapid rate of change, a limit of some sort, and delays in perceiving that limit. Ehrlich’s work was roundly criticized at the time, and later, from many quarters, and much of what he predicted did not come about. Nevertheless, can the world afford to take the risk that the climate scientists have got it wrong? Is it not in everyone’s interest to apply the Precautionary Principle in attempting to avoid the worst of their predictions - now, rather than at some future time?

When we meet people who are perpetually sick with worry that they are not attractive enough, we should not rush in with physical compliments; this is only to foster and unwittingly reward an aggravating criterion of judgement. We should learn to spot the wound in their early relationships that have made it so hard for them to trust that they could matter to others in their basic state. And that therefore perpetually evokes in them an unflattering self-image. They are not ‘ugly’ per se, they were – when it mattered – left painfully unloved and ignored to an extent that they are liable never to have recognized or mourned adequately; their arrival in the world did not delight a few people as it should have done, and therefore need compassion, sympathy and emotional validation far more than they will ever require the tools of outward beautification.

In the film footage, the dolphins don’t eat the fish. They toss the fish around like a ball, and take turns with it. Afterwards, the dolphins appear to be in a trance-like state. The filmmaker suggests that dolphins use puffer fish to enjoy a natural high, just as other animals enjoy fermented sugarcane, nectar, or berries.

I think it’s fair to say that these pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century. This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn’t afford to hire an architect. Instead, they bought a pattern book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder. The difference in cost was substantial. In 1870, for example, hiring an architect would’ve cost about a hundred dollars. At the same time, a pattern book written by an architect cost only five dollars. At that price, it’s easy to see why pattern books were so popular. Some are back in print again today, and of course they cost a lot more than they did a hundred years ago.

The term is a shorthand way for Wall Street to mark when stocks have taken a tumble, a sign that investors are anxious about the future and moving away from risky assets. Speaker 1: There's a number of things that can make investors more risk averse. One, they can grow concerned about how stocks are valued and say, is this stock really worth what I think it's worth, or worth the premium that I'm putting on it? Have valuations run up too far, too fast? Narrator: This was a factor in a bear market in 2001, when a bursting market bubble drove down stock values. Speaker 2: I believe I was asked about the markets today. I'm sorry people are losing value in their portfolios. Speaker 1: Another really important factor is the economy. Often bear markets have been affiliated with economic recessions. So that's one thing that can really put investors on edge. Narrator: Recessions have accompanied nine of the last 17 bear markets.

This film has three distinct layers: an outer, oily layer to prevent evaporation; a middle layer of lacrimal fluid, the main ingredient of tears; and an inner, mucous layer. This three layer film is replenished every time you blink, and it provides essential protection for your eyes. Most of your body is protected by skin of course, and your outer layer of skin is made of dead cells and keratin, an opaque, protective substance. Your eyes need to be transparent, however; they can't be covered by a layer of dead cells and keratin. One of the main functions of tears therefore, is to keep these cells alive. Tears are loaded with electrolyte salts, chemicals that are also found deep inside your body. These salts make your outer eye cells feel like they're inside your body, preventing them from turning into cells similar to skin cells. Tears help your eyes in other ways too. When a speck of dust gets in your eye, it's coated with mucous from glands in the white of your eye, then washed out with extra fluid from the lacrimal glands, the main tear producing glands above the eye. To protect your eyes from germs, tears also contain bacteria fighting enzymes. What's more, tears provide a good optical surface. They smooth out the microscopically uneven cells of your cornea.

    "question": "They're a home owner's nemesis and a young kid's delight. Whether they're yellow flowers dotting an otherwise perfect lawn or white puffs ready to be blown away by a sudden gust, dandelions are either hated or loved by just about everybody. What looks like a single yellow flower growing in your lawn is actually many flowers grouped together. Each section of the flower that looks like a petal is actually an individual flower in its own right. A dandelion is an aggregate of many small flowers and each individual flower has its own stamens and pistil, and therefore can reproduce without fertilization. After a dandelion has bloomed, each of the individual flowers within a single dandelion forms a seed. The seed is attached to fluffy white threads, which allow the seed to fly to a place where, if it meets favorable conditions, it can germinate to create another dandelion. Even if you hate this common weed, you've got to respect its tenacious spirit. Dandelions are native to six continents, and are found throughout the world except in the tropics. Their impressive roots, which can be up to a foot long, allow them to thrive in inhospitable environments, like big cities, where most flowers and weeds can't even survive. Cut off a dandelion at the surface and the root will grow another plant. But dandelions aren't just annoying weeds; they've been used throughout history in a variety of ways. Dandelion leaves have been eaten as salad greens and dried to make dandelion tea; and dandelion flowers have been used to make wine and schnapps. In addition, the milky juice of one kind of dandelion has been used to make a natural rubber.",

    "question": "This time we'll look at how the size and altitude of a plane influence the intensity and duration of the sonic boom. The sonic boom is a direct result of a change in the air-flow pattern around a plane's edges. The moment a plane hits speeds faster than about 768 miles per hour, or the speed of sound, it creates shock waves that travel in all directions. When these shock waves hit the ground, we hear a sonic boom. As a general rule, the bigger the aircraft, the larger the shock waves and the longer the duration of the sonic boom. The smallest aircraft capable of traveling faster than the speed of sound generates a boom that lasts one twentieth of a second. The largest supersonic aircraft creates a boom that lasts ten times longer, or half a second. However, two aircraft the same size flying at different altitudes will create sonic booms of different intensities. A craft flying higher will create a less intense sonic boom at ground level, because the shock waves have farther to travel before hitting the ground, and therefore have more time to dissipate. The sonic boom created by this high flying plane will be heard by a larger geographic area than the boom created by a low flying plane because as the shock waves travel to the ground, they spread out and increase the radius they affect. Luckily, even the most intense sonic booms can't hurt people, but they have been known to damage plaster walls and break windows.",

People want the company to tell the truth for two reasons. One is it gives them confidence that they know what went wrong. And so that means that they will presumably know what to fix. The other is that they want the company to be a truth-telling company so it can uncover the truth. The second is, on whose behalf are we acting? Is it clear that people understand that we understand that. And the third is, how do our actions benefit those people who trust us? So what is it that we're going to do in the future that's actually going to make people believe that we're going to fix the problem we created? And this is where all those facts matter, because if you've laid that out pretty clearly, then there is in fact a path to describe what it is that you’re going to do.

    "question": "White has become the standard color for airplanes’ exteriors. While stylish, it’s also a calculated decision by many airlines. White essentially reflects sunlight instead of absorbing it, like other colors do. This is great for keeping the plane’s interior temperature down. It’s the same as getting into a white car on a sunny day—its inside is probably cooler than a black car’s would be. And since constant exposure to sunlight often causes many colors to fade anyways thanks to oxidation, white becomes a practical choice. White is easy to spot, whether in the air, on the ground, or in the case of a crash, in the sea. And it’s easy to see cracks or chips in the paint when that paint is white. This detection is important because dirt and moisture can quickly collect in these chips, becoming sites of corrosion that could eat away at the aircraft’s body. This is one reason, in fact, that planes are usually painted at all instead of being left as polished metal: painted metal more readily resists corrosion than unpainted metal. You’ll often see plastic, fiberglass, or carbon fiber painted white on planes, too. This is because these parts of the plane are easily susceptible to sun damage, which the white paint helps prevent. So why aren’t all planes pure white? Advertising. After a white base, airlines will often paint their brand name on the side and their colors on the tail of the plane.",

    "question": "The travels of Sir John Mandeville first saw the light of day in the mid 13th century and states in the introduction that it’s intended as a guidebook for pilgrims venturing to the Holy Land. Unfortunately most of the guidebook information is wildly out-of-date. The travels of John Mandeville, despite posing as a guidebook, is actually just a sort of combination of many eleventh and twelfth century sources. Mandeville ripped pieces from one source bits from another and put them together in a big melting pot and one continuous narrative. A storyteller at heart, Mandeville quickly leaves the guidebook behind and starts spinning tales. Now based on events described within the travels of John Mandeville we can say fairly definitively that it was written after 1360 which would seem to jive with the 1366 date that Mandeville gifts for when he finished his narrative. Now while there is no original manuscript known to survive we do have a very early copy from 1371. It was written in French although it’s heavily peppered with Anglicanism, suggesting that the book was written in English initially and later translated to French. The 15th century copy of the work says it was originally written in Latin, translated into French and then translated into English that it might reach men of all parts of the world but this seems to be a much later edition. The work was quickly translated into all the dialects and languages of Europe, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Bohemia and even Gaelic. We have three early English manuscripts although they’re all post 14 hundred but to give something of an indication of how popular Mandeville’s work was. We do have over 300 surviving manuscripts versions of the travels of John Mandeville, as opposed to only 77 of Marco Polo. Now all of this is in an aged Pre Guttenberg so that should give you some sort of indiction of just exactly how much these works spread.",

    "question": "The war for talent refers to an increasingly competitive landscape for recruiting and retaining talented employees. In the book, Michaels, et al., describe not a set of superior Human Resources processes, but a mindset that emphasizes the importance of talent to the success of organizations.The war for talent is intensified by demographic shifts (primarily in the United States and Europe). This is characterized by increasing demand along with decreasing supply(demographically). There are simply fewer post-baby-boom workers to replace the babyboom retirement in the US and Europe (though this is not the case in most of East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Central America, South America, or the Middle East; Eastern Europe also tends to have similar demographics, namely an aging and/or shrinking labor force).While talent is vague or ill-defined, the underlying assumption is that for knowledge intensive industries, the knowledge worker (a term coined by Peter Drucker) is the key competitive resource (see the Resource-based view of the firm). Knowledge-based theories of organizations consistently place knowledge workers as a primary, competitive resource. Talent is never explicitly defined in the book, though the Preface notes, \"A certain part of talent elude description: You simply know it when you see it.\" After several further caveats, the authors go on: \"We can say, however, that managerial talent is some combination of a sharp strategic mind, leadership ability, emotional maturity, communications skills, the ability to attract and inspire other talented people, entrepreneurial instincts, functional skills, and the ability to deliver results.\" The authors offer no outside support for this assertion.A 2006 article in The Economist, which mentions the book, notes that, \"companies do not even know how to define \"talent\", let alone how to manage it. Some use it to mean people like Aldous Huxley's alphas in \"Brave New World\"—those at the top of the bell curve. Others employ it as a synonym for the entire workforce, a definition so broad as to be meaningless.\" The 'War for talent is seen by various sources as becoming irrelevant during economic downturns.

    "question": "Just like humans, plants also have internal biological clocks, referred to as a circadian rhythm. The circadian rhythm of a human being creates several physiological and chemical changes within the body. Similarly, the circadian rhythm of a plant allows it to respond to changes in roughly 24 hour cycles. So how does the sunflower circadian rhythm play a role in sun tracking behavior? Before the break of dawn, a young sunflower faces east, towards the direction of the sunrise. As the sun moves from East to West, the flower turns westward as well. When the sun sets, the flower reverts to its original position, facing East to begin the cycle again the next day. According an article published in the journal Science in 2016, researchers believe that sunflowers demonstrate this type of Heliotropism due to their stems elongating at different rates at different times of day. This is what researchers observed during their study. When the sun starts moving from East to West in the sky, the east side of the stem of a sunflower plant grows more rapidly than the West side. Due to this unequal growth on either side, the flower tends to bend in the direction of the sun. Similarly when the sun finally sets, the growth on the West side of the stem is greater than the growth on the East. As a result of this, the stem bends east, that is, in the direction where the sun would rise again the next morning.",

    "question": "If you've ever watched a dog eat you've probably marveled at how quickly it gulps down its food. You might even wonder why, no matter how hungry a dog is, it will often eat as much food as you put in front of it. Dog owners may be concerned about this behavior, but it poses no problems for the dog. People chew their food and try to teach their children to eat slowly because digestion for humans begins in the mouth. Our saliva mixes with food and prepares that food to be broken down into its primary nutrients once it enters the stomach. A dog's digestion, on the other hand, doesn't begin until the food reaches the stomach so they do not need to take time chewing their dinners. Most dogs probably eat so quickly because in the days before they were domesticated, they had to survive by eating their prey before another dog or scavenger animal stole it. The evolutionary programming of dogs dictates that they eat and keep moving. As a species in the wild, they didn't have the luxury of hanging around and eating at their leisure. Even their teeth aren't designed for them to savor their food. While most of the teeth in a human's mouth are flat and designed to facilitate chewing, most of the teeth in a dog's mouth are pointed, and designed to allow a dog to grab its food and swallow it whole. Hundreds of years of domestication hasn't changed most dogs' eating habits very much. Even if a dog has been given regular, dependable meals every day, it will still gulp those meals down in a flash, ensuring that no scavenger will take its food away.",

    "question": "The autumn term is in full swing now and deadlines are fast approaching. So, to help you with the final touches on your assignments, I wanted to say a few words about proofreading. Most people find it easy to spot problems with grammar or punctuation when reading someone else's writing but it's always much harder to see these things when looking at your own. Since you won't always have the luxury of having someone else proofread for you, let's look at a few ways to effectively do it yourself. When proofreading your own work it's important that you know what kind of errors you're looking for. Think about the kinds of things you've had trouble with in the past and try to eliminate them for a start. Now, most people know to look for things like grammar, spelling and punctuation but don't forget that the big picture is just as important. Make sure your work is organized in a logical way and that each paragraph represents a clear, distinct idea. You might take yourself to a quiet spot and try reading your work aloud. As you do, make sure it flows. Don't forget to check your referencing and citations. If possible, try to give yourself at least a day or two to complete the proofreading process.

Small businesses have gone from being traditional small-town stores selling food or clothing to sophisticated, high-tech enterprises. And in addition to the important products they produce, they create jobs for lots of people because there are so many of them. It's important for management to keep in mind which of the customers' needs the business serves, because it can't serve all their needs. Writing a business plan that everyone in the organization understands and follows will help to provide the necessary focus and direction. It's important to state clearly what the purpose of the business is. Additionally, each person within the organization must know what tasks to perform in order to fulfill that purpose. Now, if for some reason a business plan doesn't work, try hard to discover why not, rewrite it, and immediately focus on the new plan. A work of caution, however, never give up a bad plan without replacing it. A business has to have a plan because it can't afford to waste its limited resources. And, as you know, waste leads to unnecessarily high production costs. Production costs are at the heart of the company's ability to make a high quality product and sell it at an affordable price.",

    "question": "There are two main ways that rain forms, and while we're really good at forecasting one kind, we're really bad at predicting the other. The first kind, which makes up about 40% of the rain we experience, is the long-lasting, gray-skies-all-day kind of rain. This comes from giant air masses called fronts, which move around the planet; when a cold one runs into a warm one, the warm one - which is less dense - gets lifted up. As it rises, it quickly cools off, which causes tons of water vapor in it to condense right where the two air masses meet, and then fall as rain…or snow or sleet. Since the fronts themselves are large and easy to track with radar systems, not only can meteorologists tell pretty much exactly where this type of rain will fall, they can also measure the size and temperature of the two air masses and use that to accurately predict how intense the rain will be and how long it will last. But the majority of the rain we experience comes from a process called convection. This type of rain happens when heat from the ground warms up a small mass of air, which then rises and cools, causing the water vapor in it to condense and fall to the ground. That process of rising, cooling and condensing is very similar to what happens with frontal rain. But because convective rain is triggered by heat from a small patch of ground, rather than the temperature difference between two large masses of air, it’s much more complicated. It's hard to know how warm various parts of the ground will be at a particular time, whether that heat will be enough to lift a particular mass of air to a particular height, how much water vapor that particular mass of air holds, and how long that particular mass of air will stay over that particular patch of warm ground.",

    "question": "Sweetened condensed milk is a good ingredient for sweet recipes because of all the added sugar--about 25% by weight. But when sweetened condensed milk was invented in the 1800's, the original reason for adding sugar to the milk was not for flavor, but for protection against spoilage. And it works--even after you open the can, sweetened condensed milk keeps longer than fresh milk. That added sugar kills bacteria that would otherwise digest the milk and spoil it. The sugar kills not by poisoning the bacteria, but by a more direct physical process. It draws water out of the bacteria so the bacterial cells shrivel and die. Each bacterial cell has a sort of skin--technically, a membrane. Water can pass through this membrane pretty easily, but substances dissolved in the water can't. Water has a natural tendency to move toward any region where there's a high concentration of dissolved substances. A bacterial cell in a can of sweetened condensed milk finds itself immersed in an extremely concentrated solution of sugar. Water inside the cell will, therefore, pass out through the cell membrane into the sugar solution. The bacterial cell dehydrates and dies in a sea of sugary water. Sugar added to fruit has the same effect--that's the idea behind fruit preserves. Other foods are preserved with salt, exploiting the same principle.",

Specifically, if the goal of a meeting is to brainstorm or solve a problem, silent meetings have been shown to generate better ideas. But why? Solutions to a problem will often be a novel idea and novel ideas challenge convention. They can rock the boat and make people feel uncomfortable. But when participants gather around a table and generate written solutions in silence, a safe space is created. Novel ideas can emerge and people are less afraid of feeling embarrassed. Silent meetings also circumvent negative effects of something called production blocking. In a conventional meeting, only one person at a time can speak. As you wait your turn, the conversation may shift and you may lose your opportunity to raise an idea. Silent meetings allow for everyone to express ideas simultaneously. So how do you create a silent brainstorming meeting? Have people write down their ideas independently then sort them into clusters, discuss, and vote on the ideas that people like.

    "question": "The Human Rights Act can be seen as far-reaching, some would argue controversial in the UK’s history of rights. At the same time, it can be described as a somewhat cautious document that provides the starting point for a wider application of law to rights. In many ways, the freedom protections contained in the Human Rights Act were not new to people in the UK. The Act puts into UK law most of the clauses of the European Convention on Human Rights. The convention itself was devised following the end of the Second World War by the Council of Europe. UK law has played a significant role in the drafting of the Convention and the UK was among the first governments to ratify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature. That’s to say some can be expressed as a right to and others as freedom from. The 1998 act puts into place 15 specific rights and freedoms which include rights to liberty and security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry and found a family. There are also freedoms from torture, from slavery or forced labor and from discrimination on grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The Human Rights Act has been described as the start of a process. The act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European Convention which some would consider is following a baseline or a minimum standard for human rights.",

    "question": "Thanks for joining me today. I would like to focus on the profound impact of empathy on strengthening communities and fostering a more compassionate society. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, is a fundamental human trait. It forms the basis of our social bonds and enables us to connect with others on a deeper level, transcending differences in background, culture, or beliefs. Moreover, empathy is a catalyst for positive social change. It motivates individuals and communities to address social injustices, offer support to those in need, and work towards creating a fairer and more inclusive society. Furthermore, empathy enhances conflict resolution and cooperation within communities. When people genuinely empathize with each other's perspectives, they are more likely to find common ground and collaborate effectively, leading to stronger, more resilient communities. In conclusion, empathy is a powerful force for building stronger, more compassionate communities and promoting social cohesion. It is a skill that we should cultivate and encourage in ourselves and our communities, as it holds the key to a more harmonious and connected society.",

    "question": "Although exactly why and how lightning occurs is a little contentious, it is generally agreed that lightning happens between the downdrafts and updrafts of thunderstorms. Lighter particles move upwards to the top of the cloud and become positively charged, while bulkier ones descend towards the bottom of the cloud and become negatively charged. When this differential build-up of charge grows large enough, lightning is released between these regions. In reality, most of the lightning takes place within the cloud, but some bolts do find their way out and descend to the ground, which can cause fires, injuries, and general mayhem. Lightning is not only bright, but also VERY HOT. The temperature of lightning is a whopping 27,000 degrees Celsius. To put that in perspective, that temperature is nearly 5 times hotter than the surface of the Sun! When lightning strikes, it often burns the surrounding air due to its extreme temperatures. Lightning can also carry over a billion joules of energy. As electrical power is equal to energy per unit time, the power that it exudes is also humongous.

    "question": "So what's so great about silence? Well in the course of researching my book, I came across several studies into the impact that silence can have on both the body and the brain. In one study involving mice, silence was shown to promote the growth of brain cells in the part of the brain responsible for memory related to the senses. Scientists played mice a selection of sounds, including baby mouse cries, white noise, and silence, and observed that during silence, there was cell growth in the hippocampus. Another study looked at the impact of listening to music on the body, and the researchers found that if silence was inserted into a track of music, the blood pressure dropped, the heart rate reduced and the subject relaxed much more than when listening to a relaxing piece of music. This only happened when the silence was inserted in the middle of the tune itself. It didn't work for silence at the beginning or end of the experiment. So there's something about silence that comes in the middle of noise that's particularly beneficial. So silence can actually also enable people to actually say things that they've never been able to say before. I looked into the formation of the Samaritans, a support service for people that are feeling despairing or suicidal. The service was set up in the 50s by a vicar, and he started it because he had to conduct the funeral of a young girl who had taken her own life. The reason she took her own life is that she'd started her periods and thought she'd contracted some terrible disease and was dying. She was deeply ashamed of what was happening to her and had no one to talk to about it. It was this that inspired the vicar, Chad Varah, to set up the Samaritans as he didn't want people to feel that there were things that they couldn't talk about, particularly things that they were ashamed of.",

    "question": "In 1906 in New York City, the Warren family got sick with the disease called \"typhoid fever\". Typhoid fever was a scary disease without a cure. First a person would feel tired and feverish, and then they would have muscle aches, weight loss, rash and a swollen abdomen. Quite often typhoid fever would lead to death. A government worker came to the Warren home to investigate and see where the typhoid fever could have come from. As the worker investigated, he took notice of the cook Mary Mallon. Mallon had worked as a cook for many families in the early 1900s and each of them had contracted typhoid fever. It was soon realized that Mary Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of typhoid fever. That meant that she had the disease all the time but she never felt any symptoms of it. She was spreading the disease without even knowing it. Mallon was given the nickname Typhoid Mary. Doctors and scientists were very intrigued by Mallon and wanted to examine her, but she would always refuse. There was even an instance that she chased away doctors with a carving fork. Eventually she was arrested and sent to a prison. Doctors were finally able to determine that her gallbladder was where the dangerous bacteria was and they offered to remove it, but she refused. Mallon was sent to live in a quarantine hospital on North Brother Island in New York. She lived there for three years before she was released. At that point she had to agree to change occupations and not be a cook anymore. Mallon did that for a time but later changed her name to Mary Brown and began working as a cook again. Of course, families became sick and Typhoid Mary was to blame. Mallon kept running from authorities as she went from job to job and people became sick. She was finally stopped after she started an outbreak at the Sloane Hospital for Women in New York City. Mallon was quarantined for the remainder of her life. When she died in 1938, an autopsy revealed that she did in fact have live a typhoid bacteria in her gallbladder. Typhoid Maryls body was cremated and her remains were buried at the St. Raymondls Cemetery in the Bronx.",

More than 6 percent of our nation's electricity comes from hydropower. And as wind and solar power continue to grow, water can also play an important role in bringing more renewable resources on to the power grid. One way is by storing energy through a technology known as pumped-storage hydropower. Think of it as a big battery, flexible enough to respond to various power demands. When the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, electricity is in high supply, so water is pumped up to higher elevation reservoirs during this time. When the sun goes down or the wind stops blowing, water is released back to lower reservoirs, basically filling in the gaps during peak demand and generating the needed electricity. Pumped-storage is the most dominant form of energy storage on the electric grid today.

    "question": "Let's look at the size of rain, and how raindrops fall. First, we'll need the Sun. When the Sun shines on water on the Earth's surface, the heat of the Sun warms the water, turning it into an invisible gas called water vapor. This process, the changing of water into a gas, is called evaporation. Because gases are lighter than liquids, water vapor rises up into the sky, and the further you move up and away from the Earth's surface, the colder the temperature gets. So in the sky, the water vapor cools, and changes back into tiny water droplets. This change is called condensation, and is the opposite of evaporation. Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets. So when condensation occurs in the sky, clouds form and grow. Let's take a closer look. When water droplets bump into one another, they stick together and grow in size. They continue to grow until they are too heavy and fall as rain. They even grows as they bump into one another on their journey from the cloud to the ground, and every single raindrop that reaches the ground is made up of 1 million of the original tiny water droplets. Raindrops fall on the ground surface, or the Sun can shine on them and the whole process happens again. This is called the water cycle, and keeps water moving from the ground to the sky, providing the water needed for plants, animals, and people to survive.",

    "question": "With the concept of moral objectivism, what we're looking at is the idea that there can be some universal moral principles: some rules, some ideas and guidelines that are valid for all people in all social environments and all situations. The idea that we can essentially have some signposts or a road map to guide behavior is going to be consistent across all individuals. Now if we take a look at this in another perspective, we can come up with a view of moral absolutism. In the area of moral absolutism, basically, what we have is illustrated on the right-hand side of this slide, is a very firm and unyielding boundary between what is right and what is wrong. And so, within moral absolutism, basically what you have are these non-overridable principles. They must be followed. They must never be violated and there were no exceptions. It is always right. It is always wrong. And nothing is subject to interpretation, and nothing is dependent upon the situation.",

    "question": "Approach and avoidance motivation is composed of three conceptually distinct components. Approach indicates a propensity to move toward (or maintain contact with) a desired stimulus, such as vocational plans. Avoidance indicates a propensity to move away from (or maintain distance from) an undesired stimulus in order to reduce anxiety. Motivation is defined as the energization and direction of behavior. The valence of stimuli is at the core of the distinction between approach and avoidance, with positively valenced stimuli typically leading to approach and negatively valenced stimuli typically leading to avoidance. Stimuli can be external or internal, implicit or explicit, conscious or non-conscious.",

    "question": "Laughter is one of the greatest therapies in combating adversity; and whole communities and nations have frequently relied on humour to get them through their bleakest times. On august 13,1961, the barbed wire was rolled out of Berlin to create the Berlin wall. For nearly 30 years, until it was dismantled, wall jokes proliferated -especially among those living in the east. Laughing was all that was left. Jokes about those who rule you - and sometimes those who tyrannise you - are a form of folklore that has existed in societies as seemingly different as communist eastern Europe, Czarist Russia, modern Egypt, 12-century Persia, and modern day Iran. Humour can also be wonderfully subversive. It can protect self-respect and identity.",

    "question": "Are you trying to grow your nails? Nails may refer to fingernails or toenails. Fortunately, fingernails grow three to four times faster than toenails. Unfortunately, toenails are much thicker than fingernails. Fingernails can break, split, or bend quite easily. Did you know that the nails on your dominant hand grow more quickly? This is handy, since these nails are much more likely to wear down from use. Nails are made of keratin, a protein that is also found in hair and skin. Long, strong nails in children are a sign of good health. This can be a nail-biting time for teens. People who bite their nails often get hangnails. Hangnails are not really nails. A hangnail is a flap of torn skin at the root of the nail. Hangnails on toes are usually caused by dry skin.",

    "question": "And 'Flow' is an optimized state of consciousness where we feel our best and we perform our best. The research says there are three tools you can reach for. Gratitude has really precise impacts on the brain and anxiety. I like to write down 10 things that I'm grateful for, and I write down each one three times. Gratitude is literally you're just pointing out to the brain things that have already happened, that are good. And it tilts this ratio, so we're taking in a lot less negative stuff. This, by the way, lets more novel stuff come through. Gratitude can work as a 'flow trigger' that way. The second one is mindfulness - 11 minutes a day of mindfulness practice. You know, follow your breath, focus meditation basically, is enough to really calm down your nervous system, make you less emotional-reactive. Your third option is exercise - 20 to 40 minutes worth of exercise is enough. And if you're exercising for mental hygiene, right, for cognition, and I wanna get into flow, you wanna exercise until basically the voice in your head gets really quiet and your lungs open up. Both things happen because there's a global release of nitric oxide, it's a gaseous, signaling molecule that's sort of everywhere in the body. One of the things it does is it flushes stress hormones out of your system. It'll reset the nervous system, sort of back to baseline, back to zero.",

Firstly, practicing gratitude by acknowledging positive experiences helps to rewire the brain and reduce anxiety. Secondly, engaging in mindfulness for just 11 minutes a day calms the nervous system and promotes emotional stability. Hence, for mental clarity and cognitive enhancement, exercising until the mind becomes quiet and the body feels invigorated is recommended. Overall, these three tools contribute to achieving a state of flow.",

    "question": "The vocalizations are the focus of the research study. The researchers from the University of Queensland and Queensland University of Technology want to understand more about some of the species' breeding habits. The marsupials on St. Bees Island have been fitted with GPS collars which track their every move. We hope to be able to decipher this sort of koala code in their vocalizations and the potential for that to be deployed to other areas of koala conservation. Remote listening stations have been strategically placed around the island, and solar-powered mobile phones are programmed to record the bellows of vocalizations. Well, we hope to work with the koala researchers to get a better understanding of the koalas and their ecology. More generally, what we're trying to do is to understand the heartbeat of the environment. We want to be able to measure environmental health using the advanced acoustic technologies. Thanks to these recordings, scientists could be a step closer to cracking the koala code, and the research may be used to help with breeding programs in the future.",

    "question": "So the topic for today is abstraction. And this is a very important layer of computer because you can't do anything with a computer unless you have a symbolic system in place. Right. So we're talking about the origin of symbolic systems. Language is a classic symbolic system. Apparently one theory for why language evolved is that people communicated with sign language and with movement quite well for a long time. And it turned out that they wanted to communicate even while they were doing things. So, while they were trying to strangle the dinosaur, not the dinosaurs, the rhinoceros, they wanted to say \"Come help me\" and they use sign language to do it. They had to let go of the rhinoceros and the rhinoceros ran away. So you can see that it's a good idea to be able to do something with your hands and be able to communicate at the same time. Hence there come words and languages.",

They who know within a year or two, when they accumulate that kind of debt. Where is the debt coming from? It's coming from a seed that is costing a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand rupees per kilogram, depending on what you got. Seeds that used to be free, used to be theirs. Pesticides each time, the more they use, the more they have to use, 12 sprays, 15 sprays, 20 sprays. Pesticides used in just the last five years in the land areas of India has shown up by 2000 percent. That’s why the free market and globalization have brought and since we are talking about peasants, who have no money, who have no capital, they can only buy expensive seeds and expensive pesticides by borrowing. And who lend that money? The seed companies that sell the pesticides, which are the same companies that sell the seeds, as you know, are now also the major creditors.",
