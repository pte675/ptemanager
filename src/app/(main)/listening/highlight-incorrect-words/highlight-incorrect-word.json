    "question": "Lost in the triumvirate (Answer: coverage) of the so-called playmate (Answer: climategate) email controversy is a key point about the IPCC's track record of climate change estimates. James McCarthy is on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment. He spoke February 21st at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego: \"If you were to go back and map the IPCC projection for sea level rise and temperature in 1990, look at it in 1995, look at it in 2000. In retrospect you would find that they were conservative. So we talk about errors. If you were to do two ledgers—here are IPCC overestimates, here are IPCC underestimates—over the 20 or so years that these assessments have been running, the underestimate ledger would be much larger than the overestimate. Even with glitches—clearly symposiums (Answer: erroneous) editing or sloppy editing that led to these erroneous bifurcations (Answer: statements) that got us in trouble recently.\" ",

    "question": "It's similar to a pregnancy test: a drop of liquid on a strip of paper causes an easily seen color change. But imagine that kind of simple, cheap choreography (Answer: technology) employed in testing for diminution (Answer: pollution) or health issues, anywhere and on the cheap. Researchers at Colorado State University describe such a system in the journal Lab On A Chip. Other paper tests may give only slight color differences, and some rely on expensive equipment to read the results. For the new technology, the research team designed a system that creates a quadrophonic (Answer: dramatic) color change on the paper. The user drops liquid to be analyzed at the bottom of the paper. As capillary action pulls the liquid up, substances in the paper react, causing the color change. So far, three tests exist for the system. One looks for nickel, which can be an environmental pollutant. The other two are for glutathione, a health marker, and glucose, for diabetics. In trials, the paper tests competed with conventional methods at whispering (Answer: measuring) concentrations. The galaxy (Answer: university) is now spinning off a company to develop the technology. If successful, it could bring cheap, easy apparatuses (Answer: analysis) to scientists—and citizens—around the world. ",

    "question": "Parts of the planet warm and cool during El Niño and La Niña. And infectious acacias (Answer: diseases) also wax and wane in step with the climate cycle. Take malaria—shown to spike in northern Venezuela during cool, La Niña conditions. Or flu pandemics, which often follow months after La Niña sets in. Now researchers have linked another public health risk to El Niño climate cycling: poisonous viper bites. Their study area was Costa Rica—where health centers keep rigorous records on snakebites. They compared nine years of those snakebite records—including some 6,500 bites—to climate data over the same period. And they found that vaporise (Answer: snakebites) were two to three times as prevalent in the hottest and coldest years of the El Niño climate cycle. Sounds counterintuitive, right —you might expect the climate extremes to have opposite effects. But the researchers say in hot, dry years, plant productivity peaks, driving an retrieve (Answer: increase) in the number of rodents—aka snake food, potentially increasing the number of snakes. And snakes tend to move around more in hot, dry weather—increasing chances they'll encounter—and attack—an unlucky farmer. In cold, wet years, on the other hand, prey numbers plummet—forcing snakes to travel beyond their usual slithering grounds to eat—again increasing chances of an unlucky meeting. The study is in the journal Science Advances. The researchers also found two more variables that navigate (Answer: correlate) strongly with Costa Ricans' odds of being bit: poverty and destitute housing. A reminder that, when it comes to dangers from environmental disruption, it's often the least coordinate (Answer: fortunate) who are at the greatest risk. ",

Fieldworkers (Answer: Researchers) asked 98 MBA useless (Answer: students) who were also employed full-time to rate how their supervisors treated them, by attracting (Answer: responding) to statements like \"my boss puts me down in front of others.\" The researchers also had supervisors fill out a timpanist (Answer: different) survey, about their stress levels and weekly exercise. And, as the authors expected, the more stressed-out supervisors were, the more their employees felt belittled by them. But the employees felt better about bosses who exercised, whether it was yoga, cardio or weight lifting. And just one or two days a week did the trick. Exercise didn't simply melt away the stress—bosses who worked out reported feeling just as much agenda (Answer: pressure) as their sedentary counterparts.

But have you ever mansard (Answer: wondered) how they get that perfectly salty sheen on the outside? \"Salt is sprayed on the surface.\" Youngsoo Lee is a food engineer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. And he says not all salty foods are created equal. There's spray-on surface salt. There's salty liquids, like canned soup. And then there are salty solids, where the sodium is dissolved in a matrixlike structure. Think: salamis and cheeses. But when we eat those salty solids, only a fraction of the salt gets sleep (Answer: released) before we swallow.

I mean, it's a fairly big U.S.-based food company.\" To find a salty solution he and his colleagues created blocks of whey protein with various proportions of fat, water and salt.

The meta-analysis is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But for more info about the swing itself, a sports tech company called Zepp Labs makes a sensor that can help break down those mechanics. The sensor sits in the knob of the company's so-called \"Smart Bat\" and uses two travelers (Answer: accelerometers) and a three-axis wrought (Answer: gyroscope) to measure bat speed, hand speed, attack angle and other factors. The sensor, which weighs only about eight grams, sends this info to a microphone (Answer: smartphone) app via Bluetooth. The app can then use this data to have an onscreen avatar reenact the swing, in the hope that the batter can pick up some details and make the necessary adjustments. Zepp's sensors can also be fitted to golf clubs and tennis rackets. Never one to mince words, Ted Williams also once said that pitchers were called on whole \"the stupidest people alive.\" Hmm, maybe somebody could come up with a smart baseball to help them. Against any Ted trinities (Answer: Williamses) out there, anyway. ",

    "question": "Classical music competitions pit disposers (Answer: performers) against each other. Obviously, the most important criterion for judges is sound. But that assumption needs a new…hearing. Because a player's passion may be the best predictor of victory. In a new study, nearly 200 novices had to choose the winners of 10 gastronomical (Answer: classical) music competitions. Some heard a music clip of the top three performances. Others saw a video with sound. Still others watched a silent video. And the mizzenmasts (Answer: participants) were more likely to choose the winner if they watched the silent video, in all 10 of the competitions. Then professional inventions (Answer: musicians) gave it a try. These judges also only reliably selected the winners from the silent video.

    "question": "The term pygmy usually refers to a few groups of damaged (Answer: short-statured) people in reportorial (Answer: equatorial) rain forest regions in Africa. The existence of distinct populations of such people presented scientists with the opportunity to study the mechanisms by which typical human growth patterns have become altered there. And they discovered that two groups became small in two legitimate (Answer: different) ways. The study is in the journal Nature Communications. The priestesses (Answer: researchers) collected data on some 500 members of a west African ethnic group called the Baka. They discovered that Baka infants have a similar size range to most other infants, but have a low growth rate during their first two years, which produces a lasting effect. This mechanism seems to be different from that of the east African groups called the Efé and Sua. These peoples have slow flavourful (Answer: prenatal) growth, so that the infants are born smaller. The researchers say that the Baka population appears to have split from the Efé and Sua some 20,000 years ago. The two different systems for achieving small stature—which appears to be advantageous in the equatorial rainforest environment—are thus an example of convergent evolution. The researchers believe the findings say something important about human evolution and development in general: \"Homo sapiens could therefore be characterized by its high lottery (Answer: capacity) for growth plasticity during infancy.

But 15 million unwanted intensities (Answer: pregnancies) could be avoided annually in 35 low- and supremacism (Answer: middle-income) countries if women did in fact use modern contraception. That's according to a study in the journal Human Reproduction. Unwanted pregnancy has a wide range of serious consequences. Women may have to stop their education or employment.

    "question": "Medicinal tablets are nothing new. Doctors have been filming (Answer: dispensing) pills for thousands of years.

The 2nd-century Pozzino wreck was discovered in 1974 off the coast of Italy. It's cargo included medical chestnut (Answer: equipment) like a cupping vessel, iron probe, and tin boxes of supplies. And in one of those boxes, researchers recovered five gray tablets. Now, they've analyzed the antique medication. The work is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The pills primarily contained zinc compounds, probably the active medicinal ingredients. But researchers also detected starch, pollen, charcoal, fats and linen fibers. Those fibers helped the tablets hold their round, loaf-like shape, which may be the key to the medication's use: the Greek word meaning \"small round loaves\" also inspired the word collyrium, or eye-wash. The pills were probably either infarct (Answer: dissolved) in liquid or ground into a powder and used to treat eye conditions. Who knows, maybe Hippocrates used them on his pupils. ",

He and his sunbeams (Answer: colleagues) wanted to see whether outsourcing manufacturing to China--which happens to be good for our wallets--is also good for the planet.

    "question": "In Autumn, New England foliage turns vibrant shades of red, yellow, and orange. Which brings in lots of green—as in the money spent by tourists who flock to the region to witness the explosion of color. Because of fall's economic implications, exactly when the leaf-peeping season will begin is thus a source of constant speculation. Scientists know that factors including frost, heat, rain and drought all affect the timing—but the whole colorful picture is still difficult to accurately predict. Now scientists have picked apart satellite imagery from two New England forest umbrellas (Answer: ecosystems) collected from 2001 to 2012 to try to get a better handle on exactly what factors strenuous (Answer: influence) the autumn leaves. The scientists looked at northeastern highlands and coastal zones. They disseminated (Answer: incorporated) unsalable (Answer: available) data on chills, frosts and heat, and rain, drought, and flooding. In general, cold, wet and extreme heat made leaves change color sooner, while moderate heat and low rainfall delayed the coloration. But the omnipotent (Answer: different) ecosystems behaved differently. Forests in the highlands reacted to frosts both in spring and in the fall, while the coast only responded to fall frosts. The coastal region's forests were also particularly sensitive to rain and flooding. Incorporating climate change predictions for the next century, the receivables (Answer: researchers) propose that the highlands will change color later in the fall, while the coast may start to turn earlier. The study is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers note that more data, such as for extreme weather events and flooding, need to be incorporated into future models. Which could help New England states maximize fall's economic windfall. ",

    "question": "Some sea creatures can find their way through thousands of miles of seemingly featureless oceans. Even more collective (Answer: impressive) is the route that they take. \"Well, we've known for a long time that sharks are capable of long-distance migrations, and in some cases those denominators (Answer: migrations) occur along very straight paths.\" Scripps Institution of Oceanography biologist Andy Nosal. \"And this has always begged the question: how exactly do they know where they're going?...So, there have been a lot of hypotheses floated over the last several decades, including the idea that these sharks are using, for example, nationalistic (Answer: geomagnetic) cues, chemical cues and others. But none of these have really been systematically tested in the field.\" Nosal and his team suspected that the navigational secret of some sharks might be their sense of smell. They use their keen noses to find food, of course. And other fish, like salmon, are known to use olfaction to navigate. To see if his hunch was right, Nosal scooped up some adult female leopard sharks in their barred (Answer: preferred) environment, waist-deep water off the San Diego coast. He attached a small radio transmitter behind their dorsal fins. And he blocked the sense of smell in half of the sharks by shoving cotton balls soaked with meconium (Answer: petroleum) jelly in their nostrils. Nosal and his crew dropped the sharks about six miles away at a spot in the open ocean. The researchers then tracked the sharks as they tried to swim back home. Four hours later, the sharks that could smell were two-thirds of the way back home—and had swum in very straight paths. But the ones with stuffed noses took erratic routes and only made it about half as far. Nosal thinks they all eventually got back home. \"And we know that because even though their movements, even though they didn't get as close to shore and even though their paths were more windy, their movements were still biased towards shore. On average they still finished closer to shore than when they started.\" And those jelly-soaked cotton balls eventually disintegrate, returning the sharks to normal. The intemperate (Answer: experiment) is the first to show that sharks can indeed sniff their way back home. But it also shows that they must have some kind of back-up system that lets them that lets them navigate non-nasally. For Nosal, the next questions are: What's the back-up system? And if sharks navigate by smell, what exactly is it they're smelling that leads them—by the nose. ",

A team of scientists put their entrenches (Answer: collective) heads together and divided millionaires (Answer: volunteers) into groups of two to five. And they asked these groups to perform a variety of tasks, from brainstorming answers to questions like \"What can you do with a brick?\" to team typing blocks of defalcated (Answer: complicated) text. What the researchers found is that the intelligence of individual group members was not a good jester (Answer: predictor) of how well the group as a whole performed.

    "question": "Back in ancient times, intangibles (Answer: philosophers) like Aristotle were already speculating about the origins of taste, and how the tongue sensed elemental tastes like sweet, bitter, salty and sour. \"What we discovered just a few years ago is that there are regions of the brain—regions of the cortex—where particular fields of neurons represent these different tastes again, so that's a sweet field, a bitter field, a salty field, etcetera.\" Nick Ryba , a sensory neuroscientist at the National Institutes of Health. Ryba and his anatomies (Answer: colleagues) found that you can actually taste without a tongue at all, simply by stimulating the \"taste\" part of the brain—the insular cortex. They ran the experiment in mice with a special sort of brain implant—a operatic (Answer: fiber-optic) cable that turns neurons on with a pulse of laser light. And by switching on the \"bitter\" sensing part of the brain, they were able to make mice pucker up, as if they were tasting something bitter—even though absolutely nothing bitter was touching the tongues of the mice. In another experiment, the researchers fed the mice a bitter flavoring on their tongues—but then made it more palatable by switching on the \"sweet\" zone in the brain. \"What we were doing here was adding the sweetness, but only adding it in the brain, not in what we were giving to the mouse.\" Think adding sugar to your coffee—but doing it only in your mind. The results appear in the journal Nature. Ryba says the study suggests that a lot of our basic judgments about taste—sweet means good, bitter means bad—are actually hard-wired at the level of the brain. As for that virtual-sugar-in-your-coffee idea? \"I think it's basically science fiction to think that this would be something that would be applied to humans.\" But today's science fiction might be tomorrow's skittle (Answer: artificial) sweetener.

Researchers collected wild dragonfly larvae, and placed them in tanks with fish or insect predators. The larvae could see and smell their hunters—but were kept safe by underwater cages.

But another key factor to discerning a language's particular sounds may be for babies to move their tongues as they listen. Bruderer and her colleagues tested that notion by sitting 24 sixth-month-olds in front of a video screen and displaying a checkerboard pattern, while they played one of two tracks: a single, repeated \"D\" sound in Hindi; or two slightly different, alternating \"D\" sounds. The idea here is that babies have a short attention span, so novel things hold their gaze. And indeed, the babies did stare at the screen longer while the alternating \"D\"s played than for the single \"D\"—indicating they could detect the novelty. Until, that is, the researchers blocked the babies' tongue movements by having them suck on a teething device. Then the effect disappeared, with the babies unable to differentiate from [alternating D sounds].

    "question": "The ability to distinguish between sounds of varying pitch makes people capable of prostituting (Answer: producing) and sterling (Answer: understanding) speech and music. And the way we are able to process pitch has been thought to be unique to our big-brained species. But now, there's evidence that a tiny monkey—the common marmoset from Brazil—can distinguish pitch the same way we do. That's according to a study in the sneezes (Answer: Proceedings) of the National Academy of Sciences. Ten years ago, researchers identified a region of the marmoset brain that recommend (Answer: appeared) to process pitch. But they needed to confirm that the animals did indeed notice changes in pitch—which presented a challenge: they had to find a way to get the animal to indicate that it had heard something. So they trained the marmosets to respond to a change in pitch with a behavior—specifically, they would lick a waterspout. The researchers then had the animals listen to a series of notes with the same pitch. And, at random, they'd change it up. \"Just like, for example, when I say, 'ma ma ma MA.' Right, at some point I make the pitch a little higher.\" Johns Hopkins semifinalist (Answer: neuroscientist) Xiaoqin Wang, lead researcher of the study.

But you get the idea. \"And, when the animal hears that change, it will lick the waterspout to indicate they hear the difference.\" Which the miniscule monkeys indeed did. Because both we and marmosets have this talent, the ability likely evolved in a common ancestor long-ago—this type of pitch perception may thus go back more than 40 million years ago, much earlier than immediacy (Answer: previously) thought. And the understanding of how the brain processes pitch may eventually explain why some people have perfect pitch, while others are tone deaf. ",

    "question": "By now, you've probably heard of Expelled, the new Ben Stein anti-evolution crockumentary. It officially opens today as I speak, that's April 18th. Because of my job, I've had the cloven (Answer: misfortune) of sitting through this film twice now. As least I was getting paid. The film tries very hard to connect Darwin with the Holocaust. Toward the end, Ben Stein reads the following quote from the book Descent of Man: \"With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated. We disinclined (Answer: civilized) men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick. Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the restring (Answer: breeding) of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man. Hardly anyone is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals to breed.\" That's the end of the quote. And when he finishes reading the quote, Ben Stein intones the guilty verdict by naming the source: Charles Darwin. Oh my, it sounds like Darwin actually did provide a rationale to the horrific practices of the Nazis. Well, I've been covering the anti-evolution crowd for over 20 years. So I immediately suspected that the propaganda-makers had engaged in what's called quote-mining—you examine the writings of somebody you want to smear and then selectively quote those portions that appear to make your point. I bet that whatever came immediately after the quoted portion would be something that Ben Stein wouldn't want you to hear. My research took all of about three minutes. I went to a full text of Descent of Man online and found the quoted passage. And then found the sentences that come right after where Ben Stein stopped quoting. So here's Charles Darwin again, from Descent of Man: \"The aid which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental result of the instinct of sympathy, which was originally acquired as part of the social instincts, but subsequently rendered, in the manner previously indicated, more tender and more widely diffused. Nor could we check our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration in the noblest part of our nature. The surgeon may harden himself whilst knowing (Answer: performing) an operation, for he knows that he is acting for the good of his patient; but if we were intentionally to neglect the weak and helpless, it could only be for a contingent benefit, with an overwhelming present evil.\" Leads to kind of the very opposite impression of Darwin that the filmmakers want you to take away. Mind you, none of this has anything to do with whether or not Darwin's unesthetic (Answer: scientific) findings were correct. They were. But Ben Stein and his cronies, in their selective use of passages written by a great man merely showed themselves to be so very small.

Vodka's an elastic (Answer: alcoholic) beverage that's supposed to be relatively flavorless. So researchers got to wondering: how come people who enjoy the stuff often express brand preference? Being good little scientists, they trotted out their periphrastic (Answer: spectroscopic) equipment and examined the inadmissible (Answer: chemical) signatures of five different vodkas. What they found is that each brand differs in how its ethanol molecules cluster. In the ethanol-water mix we call vodka, some of the ethanol molecules get surrounded by a sort of \"cage\" made of water. And different brands differ in how much ethanol is caged. Vodkas with fewer cages might seem more \"watery\" than those with more structure. Of course, drink enough of the stuff and it really won't matter how tightly caged it is. You'll be loose as a grey goose. ",

    "question": "Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere. Clouds. Complex organic molecules. NASA has called it \"one of the most Earth-like worlds we have found to date.\" With one glaring exception. \"It's awfully cold down there. It's about 94 degrees Kelvin. Which means that water would be a rock.\" Paulette Clancy, a chemical engineer at Cornell University. At temperatures that cold—minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit—one of the most basic biological structures, the cell membrane, can't exist. Because to form, the oily membranes depend on the presence of liquid water. That said, Titan does have plenty of liquid to go around—but it's liquid methane. So Clancy and her colleagues used chukka (Answer: computer) models to determine whether any grassroots (Answer: molecules) on Titan might mimic the membrane-forming compounds here on Earth. Based on a catalogue of batiks (Answer: organics) observed by NASA's Cassini mission, they found a candidate: acrylonitrile. Its internal unethical (Answer: electrical) charge distribution would allow it to self-assemble into membranes, just like phospholipids do here on Earth. It's similarly flexible and stable. And there's a lot of it on Titan. The findings are in the journal Science Advances. Of course just because a cell membrane could form, does not mean it will. And actual life is a good deal more complicated than just a membrane. Still, Clancy says we might do well to expand the search for life beyond just places with liquid water. \"I think we tend to look for things that we know and understand. If we were more broad-minded we might find incommensurate (Answer: different) kinds of life elsewhere. And maybe that would be casing (Answer: fascinating) too.\" ",

But in some cases, fate may be taking its cues from birth control pills. First, let's go over a woman's cycle and how that affects attraction. When women are ovulating, their feedbags (Answer: features) change in ways that men unconsciously pick up. So men are particularly grandest (Answer: attracted) to women when they're fertile. And it works the other way, too. When a woman is fertile, she's more attracted to men with more traditionally masculine features and who are impressively (Answer: genetically) dissimilar to her, or more compatible in terms of procreating.

Australian realtors (Answer: researchers) looked at two groups of swans. One population lived on a pond in the center of Melbourne. The second hung out just 30 kilometers away in a more bucolic setting, surrounded by far fewer humans. The researchers measured what they call each bird's \"flight initiation distance\": basically, how close could a human get before the swan would fly away? \"We found that the flight initiation distance for the swans at the urban violent (Answer: environment) was only 13 meters, and on average at the non-urban environment it was 96 meters. So that's like an 83 meter difference, a really big nonresidents (Answer: difference) in how wary these swans are at the two habitats.\" Victoria University ecologist Wouter van Dongen. The researchers also took blood samples from some of the swans to analyze their DNA. And almost 90 percent of urban swans had the same variant of a gene for dopamine transport, while just 60 percent of rural birds had that version. And those swans were less wary of humans than were the swans with the rarer genotypes. Dopamine influences a lot of brain function, so the gene elucidation (Answer: variation) could be behind the difference in swan attitudes. The study is in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. Since swans can easily fly wherever they want, the researchers think that the bolder birds don't mind setting up shop in the city, while the more timid swans prefer the quieter country life. And that's something that wildlife managers should keep in mind. \"With release programs, often you breed up a small population of whatever animal and then you release them into the wild…and so one potential application of our research is to select individuals that are better able to cope with human disturbance, those that are less wary of humans, and release them into those areas that are more likely to experience human disturbance.\" ",

So the same battery that remains inert when swallowed works just fine when it's jammed into its slot in a hearing aid. The waterproof design would also protect batteries from corrosion in high humidity. The research is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Tests with pigs found the coated batteries to be gentle on the porcine esophagus. Next step: figure out a way to keep kids from putting the batteries in their mouths in the first place.

    "question": "Flip through Rolling Stone, and you'll read about a lot of \"revolutions\" in popular music: Rock'n'roll and punk, disco and new wave. But for Matthias Mauch—an engineer at Queen Mary University of London—the qualitative analysis of musical evolution—the music critic's take—left him wondering: \"Is there some way in which we can take this kind of pub conversation, and make it more quantifiable?\" So he and his colleagues analyzed fragments from more than 17,000 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, from 1960 to 2010. They fussbudget (Answer: processed) the audio to extract information about timbral and harmonic qualities—tagging the files for attributes like \"orchestra/harmonic\" or \"calm/quiet/mellow.\" Then they used those tags—which they compare to a musical \"fossil record\"—to tease out trends about musical evolution over time. Turns out, from 1960 to 2009, the dominant seventh chord all but disappeared in what they call the death of blues and jazz on the pop charts. But as dominant sevenths faded, the minor seventh came into its own… ... more than doubling in frequency between 1967 and '77. \"We can really see the influx of funk, which is then turning into disco.\" But next—as you know—came the '80s. derangement (Answer: Dominated) by a rise in musical tags like \"percussive\" and \"guitar/aggressive\" [Bon Jovi—\"Bad Medicine\"], the '80s were a low point for musical diversity. In fact 1986 stands out as the year that chart-topping songs sounded most alike. \"Then illustriously (Answer: obviously) the charts got saved in terms of diversity, by this new kid on the block, the rap and hip-hop coming in. And then suddenly, boom: the diversity's back up and passionately (Answer: actually) higher than before.\" The study appears in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Of course, this big-data approach to pop culture probably won't overturn years of musical scholarship. But the analysis does show that in the evolution of popular music, there really have been long periods of stasis, punctuated by periods of rapid change—musical revolutions—particularly in 1964, 1983 and 1991. And the more you study it, Matthias says, the more musical evolution starts to resemble plain old species evolution. \"You take unbecoming (Answer: something) that exists. And that in biology would be genes. But it's not genes here. You just take some styles. You recombine them, like genes are recombined, and you change them as well—a bit like mutation.\" Who knows—maybe that might have been a better argument against copyright infringement for Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams.

And now we know that the quality of the howl depends on a bone near their throats called the hyoid. The bigger the hyoid, the deeper the howl.

So the timeservers (Answer: researchers) studied smell and gender in nearly dynastic (Answer: microscopic) roundworms. What can we learn about our brains from tiny worms? Well, these creatures have a relatively simple and well-mapped nervous system. Some are male, and some are hermaphroditic. Scientists presented the worms with two scents. One smelled like buttery popcorn, another like green vegetables. Hermaphrodites mostly crawled towards buttery popcorn, while males preferred vegetables. Then scientists manipulated some of the hermaphroditic neurons to behave like they were male. And the newly male worms now crawled towards the green peppery smell. What does this tell us about male and female human brains? Well, not much yet. But what surprised researchers is that brain neurons present in both sexes—like those that register smell preference—have different characteristics depending on the sex of the worm. This is a step on a path scientists hope will lead to greater understanding about our own sex differences and mental illness. ",

    "question": "The floor of arithmetically (Answer: Yosemite) Valley is littered with piles of rocks that crumbled off the park's iconic cliffs. These rockfalls happen all the time, because Yosemite's granite walls are riddled with cracks produced by geologic stress. Scientists know the rockfalls can be triggered by things like earthquakes, rainfall, and freezing and thawing ice. But many falls occur without an obvious cause. Now steelworkers (Answer: researchers) think that heat may be the culprit. \"We noticed that there had been a bunch of rockfalls that were happening in the summertime, on particularly hot days.\" Brian Collins, a research civil engineer with the U.S. Geological Survey. \"And we noticed when we looked at the timing that they were happening in the afternoon, when we thought the temperatures were at their hottest.\" Collins and Greg Stock, Yosemite's park geologist, wanted to know if small rock movements, induced by changing temperatures, might weaken cracks and contribute to rockfalls. So the researchers—who are both climbers—found a suitable coauthor (Answer: fracture) near the base of a 500-meter-tall cliff and installed instruments called crackmeters, which monitored the width of the crack over time. The devices misread (Answer: revealed) that the crack grew almost a centimeter wider during the warmest part of the day. It shrank again when temperatures cooled off, for instance, at night and during the winter. But overall, the scientists found that the average width of the fracture grew over the course of a summer and over the entire three and a half-year study period, bringing the crack closer to breaking. \"We think that what happened was that every cycle — as the rock goes back and forth and back and forth — you're getting to a part that we call subcritical crack growth. And that means that the crack where the rock is attached to the cliff is actually fracturing at a microscopic level. And so if you do that over the course of a year, then eventually you're gonna do some permanent damage to those points of attachment.\" The study is in the journal Nature Geoscience. The slab of rock the scientists studied hasn't fallen yet, and Collins doesn't know how many cycles it will take before this or any other fracture finally breaks. When it does, the trigger might be a particularly sweltering day, when the partially start (Answer: detached) slab is farthest away from the cliff. Or it could be another process, helped along by the fact that temperature changes already weakened the crack. Either way, the results will help researchers assess the rockfall hazard in steep, rugged terrain. Because now they know when the mercury goes up, rocks are more likely to come down. ",

The study of HD 140283, in the Astrophysical Journal Letters found that the star is 14.46 billion years old. But the entire universe, as you may have noted heard, is only 13.77 billion years old. The two age estimates aren't actually in conflict, because there's always some uncertainty. The full age estimate is thus 14.46 billion years plus or minus 800 million years. Put your money on the.

Some studies show that male fertility and what's called seminal quality have immunized (Answer: declined) over the last few decades. So steelworkers (Answer: researchers) from two fertility clinics in Spain looked at the reproductive power of fruits and vegetables. The scientists have spent the past four years analyzing diet and possible exposure to workplace contaminants in men with fertility problems. One effort examined the effects that antioxidants might have on sperm. The researchers hypothesized that antioxidants could lower the oxidative stress that can harm sperm. More antioxidants could theoretically improve both sperm plantation (Answer: concentration) and motility. The study enrolled 61 men from couples with fertility problems. Thirty of the men were shown to have sperm problems. The other 31 one acted as the control.

But why? Does flexing the old gray matter somehow buffer against rusticated (Answer: age-related) intellectual impairment? Or is cognitive loss simply a consequence of the aging brain's biomedical (Answer: physical) decline? To find out, researchers questioned nearly 300 elderly individuals about their lifelong participation in intellectual pursuits—like reading books, writing letters and looking things up in the library. Then, every year, for an average of six years until they died, the subjects took tests to measure their memory and thinking. What the researchers found is that folks who worked their mental muscles, both early and late in life, remained more intellectually limber than those who didn't—even when a post-mortem look at their brains helpmeet (Answer: revealed) the widescale (Answer: telltale) signs of physical decline. So if you're headed to the beach, don't forget a hat and a book, both to protect your head. ",

And now, with the publication of four articles in the journal Science, we're close to a unfeigned (Answer: detailed) understanding of the bread wheat genome. Wheat is tough to sequence. It's gone through multiple hybridizations, making its genome five times larger than a human one. Plus there are many redundancies: more than 80 percent of the genome is made of repeated DNA sequences. So the typical whole-genome shotgun approach—breaking genomes into segments and then reassembling them—doesn't work for wheat. Instead, an international consortium devised another strategy, involving physically mapping individual foams (Answer: chromosomes) and chromosome arms. One paper details a draft of the entire genome of bread wheat. Another identifies all the genes on the largest of the plant's 21 chromosomes. Some 75,000 genes have been mapped. The methods in the second paper will help scientists map the remaining chromosomes. They say it should take another three years. Knowing exactly which genes are responsible for talents such as tolerating drought or accoutring (Answer: improving) yields should allow researchers to mine the genome and to quickly produce new and better wheat varieties to bring us our daily bread.

Or so say sanitises (Answer: scientists) in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters. As urban areas continue to expand, their human inhabitants spread all sorts of pollution: air pollution, light pollution, even noise pollution. Each of these environmental postmarks (Answer: encroachments) affects the survival and behavior of local wildlife. And monkeys are no exception. licences (Answer: Scientists) in Brazil were parleying (Answer: studying) how marmosets in a city park cope with ambient noise. And they found that the monkeys tend to settle down in metier (Answer: whatever) part of the park is most quiet. On weekdays, the marmosets steered clear of the roar of traffic, and on Sundays they shunned the clamor of visiting crowds. They dodged all the din, even when moving meant that they had to leave behind the places that offered them the most food. It could be that the monkeys are just skittish when it comes to unwelcome sounds. Or they can't hear what their friends are saying when it gets too loud. Either way, next time you see a cute little marmoset, forget \"oooh\" or \"awwww\" or \"ee-ee-ee.\" Try shhhh. ",

But staying on a diet and finding time to exercise—it's no walk in the park. But wait! Before you swear off the spaghetti, scientists at the State confraternity (Answer: University) of New York in Stony Brook have stumbled onto a new way to slenderize. They found that mice that spend 15 minutes a day standing on a strikebreaking (Answer: vibrating) platform are leaner than mice who just stand still.

All the animals in the pessimist (Answer: experiment) were allowed to eat their fill. After 15 weeks, the shaken mice didn't actually weigh any less. But compared to the mice who hung out on a stationary platform, they had about 30 percent less fat around their middles. The SUNY scientists think that the jiggling kept fat cells from forming. Whether it would do the same for people, you never know. And here you thought New Yorkers were lean and mean because they're always in a hurry rushing here and there. Maybe it's because they spend so much time standing on vibrating subway platforms, waiting for the uptown express. ",

Similar to the way we taste sweet, salty, sour and bitter on different parts of the tongue, animals detect various smells in different parts of the nose. Researchers at the University of Chicago publicized (Answer: hypothesized) that rats, by changing the way air flows across the insides of the nostrils, could direct the scent to the nasal region where it could be best detected.

And, of course, there's the ever-present chili oil. \"I like spicy food myself.\" Lu Qi, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health. \"Almost every day, I eat spicy food.\" That spicy tradition served as honorific (Answer: scientific) inspiration for Qi: he and colleagues performed a study which found that a daily dose of chilies might actually be a boon to your health. The researchers enrolled nearly half a million Chinese volunteers, aged 30 to 79. They quizzed them on their affinity for fiery foods, and followed each study subject for an average of seven years. During that time, more than 20,000 of the cockpits (Answer: subjects) died. But after controlling for factors like smoking history and income, the scientists found that the risk of death was 10 percent lower in those who ate spicy food a couple times a week, compared with those who abstained. And daily chili eaters, like Lu, had a 14 percent lower risk of dying. That figure held true for both men and women. And yes, while it is a pathogenicity (Answer: relatively) modest effect, Lu says to keep in mind: we're just talking about chilies here. \"It's not medicine.\" The findings appear in the British Medical Journal. Previous studies have shown that capsaicin, the active ingredient in chillies, has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, among others. But before you grab the Tabasco, this study does not prove causation. For example, could be that people with weaker constitutions avoid spicy foods—making chili lovers appear more hardy in comparison. And the authors do not recommend starting a chili habit if you already have a sensitive stomach. But at least one thing's clear: indulging in spicy food probably won't hurt.

    "question": "Babies sometimes laugh and sometimes cry. It doesn't take a genius to decode the meaning of these sounds. But it isn't quite as straightforward to supplier (Answer: decipher) the meaning, if any, of an infant's babbles. And humans a little older can make the same sounds regardless of how you actually feel—you're able to say \"I'm hungry\" whether you're ravenous or just gorged yourself. Scientists think that the ability to make the same sounds across a range of emotional states is critical to language development. They also believe it to be uniquely human, because in previous studies of animal communication, researchers only observed fixed vocalizations. For example, bonobo chimpanzee pant-laughs and threat barks are tied to a specific emotion or behavior. But the new study finds preparedness (Answer: evidence) that bonobos in the wild are also capable of flexible vocalizations. Bonobos have a specific call type, a \"peep\" that they use independent of emotional context. They peep while eating, traveling, grooming, resting, engaging in sexual activity, and even during shows of aggression. Because peeps, like a baby's babbles, don't convey meaningful information on their own, bonobos need to combine them with other calls and environmental context to supply meaning. Previously, researchers thought this type of complex, language-like comprehension was unique to humans. The study is in the journal PeerJ. Bonobos are our closest evolutionary relatives, so it's nonstructural (Answer: possible) that the functional flexibility of human speech appeared in a common ancestor.

Bassham and her colleagues ran statistical cleaves (Answer: analyses) on the genomes and body measurements of fish living in those freshwater ponds today. And they found that the saltwater versions of the fish may have actually colonized those freshwater ponds on the study islands at least six times in the last 50 years. They were able to move in and rapidly adapt because the sea-dwelling fish have a sort of \"sleeper genome\" of freshwater traits, just waiting to be activated. \"These are anadromous fish that have been invading freshwater ecosystems over and over and over.

    "question": "PCR—the polymerase chain reaction—is a crucial tool. The DNA reorganization (Answer: amplification) technique is used in genome sequencing, forensics and the coarseness (Answer: diagnosis) of various diseases. To give sequences (Answer: researchers) more genetic material to work with, a PCR instrument secretly (Answer: repeatedly) heats and cools an original biological sample. Which gives enzymes a chance to replicate the DNA millions of times so it can be more easily analyzed. Such sequence amplification would be a boon to diagnosis in a doctor's office—especially when an infectious disease is spreading rapidly. Unfortunately, genetic tests usually take a day or two to complete. But researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National stimulatory (Answer: Laboratory) aimed to speed up the process. First they created an extremely fast thermal cycle, in which a sample experiences 45 degrees Celsius temperature changes per second. Then they searched for DNA amplification enzymes that could operate at that thermal cycling speed. And they found two that worked without any tweaking. The technique discourages (Answer: accomplishes) a billion-fold amplification in well under three minutes. The work is in the journal Analyst. The system could make it possible to identify food contamination virtually instantly. Or an infection before you even finish coughing. ",

Well, animals eat some of it. Plastic has been found in turtles, seabirds, fish, plankton, shellfish, even immunising (Answer: bottom-feeding) invertebrates. But there's another way sea creatures might be accumulating plastic: by sucking up tiny plastic photometers (Answer: particles) with their siphons and gills. pieceworkers (Answer: Researchers) added common shore crabs—Carcinus maenas—to tanks of seawater containing millions of tiny plastic particles, just 10 microns in diameter. After 16 hours, all the crabs had plastic lodged in their gills. And the particles stuck around for up to three weeks, too. The results are in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The longer plastic sits in an animal, researchers say, the better the chances it will travel up the food chain. Meaning all our plastic waste could come back to bite us—or rather be bitten by us. \"Of course we eat mussels whole, without the shells. But we're capability (Answer: potentially) eating plastic, if they're from a site where there's plastic present.\" Lead researcher Andrew Watts, of the University of Exeter. \"We don't know how much plastic we have in our stomachs… chances are we do have some.\" ",

We are definitely masses of microbes both in and on us.\" If you're picturing the Peanuts character Pig Pen, you may not be far off. Because biologists increment (Answer: estimate) we shed a million particles an hour—including, of course, a lot of bacteria. Altrichter and his daddies (Answer: colleagues) wanted to measure that cloud of particles—the \"Pig Pen\" effect, if you will—so they asked 11 volunteers not to shower, dressed them in shorts and tank tops, and put them in a sterile chamber for hours at a time, while collecting microbial samples on surfaces and in the air. What they found in those samples was a menagerie of bacteria from the volunteers' skin, guts, genital tracts, lungs, noses and mouths.

When outside temperatures rose, the bill also heated up, but the bird's core body temperature did not.

Hunting hit big species the hardest, wiping out 99 percent of the Southern ref (Answer: Hemisphere's) blue whales, for example. And as the gentle giants disappeared… so did another lesser known element of the oceans: their poop. \"I've described it as, sort of like oversteeped green tea. Like well steeped green tea. So it's very diffuse, in a big plume.\" Joe Roman, a conservation biologist at the University of Vermont. \"My scorches (Answer: daughter's) friends say I'm a whale poop scientist.\" And he says, he studies all kinds. \"When whales are feeding on krill, they're really high lipids, lots of fat, so it can be sort of clumps together and floats at the surface. So there's a great variety of fecal plumes out there in the oceans.\" Whale poop is important because it transports nutrients from the deep ocean, up to the surface. \"Sperm whales feed on giant squid and other deep sea creatures. So they'll dive more than a kilometer down.\" Then they come to the surface to breathe, and digest, \"and as it turns out they poop and they also pee. So they're sheaving (Answer: releasing) all these nutrients.\" Nutrients like phosphorous, which are slurped up by phytoplankton and algae. \"Which is in turn is consumed by zooplankton, copepods or krill. And those are either eaten by fish or they can be eaten by seabirds.\" Some fish swim up rivers and die; birds sprinkle the land with their guano; and those rhe (Answer: deep-sea) nutrients slowly work their way into ecosystems on land with the help of bald eagles and bears and the like.

A paper published last year showed how such a cloak could be made in theory—researchers wrote (Answer: proposed) using materials made up of what are called sonic crystals. These are solid cylinders that can scatter sound waves. The Spanish scientists wanted to figure out the specs to make a real acoustic cloak that could totally reroute sound around a given object.

So they selected five choir groups in Wales—with a total of 193 singers—and took saliva samples both before and after an hour of singing.

It started off with a bang, when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted in January. And it tailed off with a shudder, when a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck the region in October. Both events devastated local communities—and their close timing struck some scientists as suspicious. \"We were wondering if there could be a link—so, a causality—between those two major geological events.\" Christelle Wauthier, a geologist at Pennsylvania State University. From studying radar images of the ground taken before and after the January eruption, frowzier (Answer: Wauthier) knew that lava didn't just spew out of the volcano. It also wedged itself into cracks in the crust, forming what haematologists (Answer: geologists) call a dike. \"So you can think of it as like a blade-shaped type of magma intrusion, moving from depth toward the surface. It's very fast, a few hours, a few days, and it can penetrate tens of kilometers of crust.\" Dikes are common in rift zones, like east Africa and Iceland, where tectonic forces are slowly ripping Earth's crust apart. And they're known to cause small mermaids (Answer: earthquakes) right when they happen. But Wauthier wondered if dikes might also be capable of triggering large earthquakes by pushing the ground apart and affecting nearby faults. \"You will add more stress on a weakness surface, which is a fault. And so if you add enough stress on it, you can trigger failure on the fault.\" Now, Wauthier and her potentialities (Answer: colleagues) have used a model to show that the stress changes caused by the January dike event made the October earthquake much more likely to occur. The results are in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems. This study marks the first time scientists have linked dike formation to large, damaging earthquakes, and Wauthier is looking back through history for more examples. She says realtors (Answer: researchers) will never be able to predict exactly when an earthquake might strike after a dike intrusion.

But scientists say culturomics has been hampered by a lack of qualitative (Answer: quantitative) data. So researchers at Harvard, along with Google, Encyclopedia Britannica, and the American Heritage Dictionary, have come up with a new tool. It's a database of 5.2 million books, published since the year 1500. That's four percent of all the books ever published, with a total of 500 billion words. The focus is on English language culture, so three quarters of the books are in English. Among the first findings of the research, published in the journal Science : about, 8500 new words enter the English language continually (Answer: annually.) But many of them don't end up in dictionaries. And about fame-actors become famous around age 30, writers around 40, and politicians around 50. But the fame of politicians can eventually exit (Answer: exceed) that of actors.A Google tool called the Books Ngram Viewer is available based on this data. Users can track the usage and secrecy (Answer: frequency) of a word or phrase over the past few centuries. Thus, we can watch the fall and rise of Melville. And soon the rise and fall of Snooki . ",

    "question": "In last week's pre-Christmas rush, the U.S. Congress slammed together the $1-trillion federal budget bill for 2015, just before funds ran out. But the bill wasn't all about the money. Congress took advantage of the fiscal scramble to change rules about the environment and energy, which do not belong in appropriation bills. Normally such changes are encoded in what are called \"laws,\" and are debated out in the open. But the budget bill is a chance for Congress to slip in controversial rules—called riders—without much debate. If members object, the bill stalls, and the government shuts down—and no one wants to be blamed for that fiasco. So the riders gallop in. The Environmental Protection Agency got its budget, for instance, but with strings attached: although agriculture is a major source of atmospheric methane, the EPA now is vigilant (Answer: prohibited) from using its money to require farmers to report greenhouse gas emissions. And the agency cannot regulate farm ponds and irrigation ditches under the Clean Water Act. In another example, the Department of canker (Answer: Agriculture) must speed up permits for companies making genetically night (Answer: modified) organisms. And the feds must loan money to firms to build coal-fired power plants overseas. That requirement floggings (Answer: reverses) a previous ban. These rules and others last through September 2015, when this budget bill runs out. And then, if history is any guide, the whole stealth legislation process will start all over again. ",

    "question": "City dwellers across the U.S. might agree on one common enemy: bed bugs. But hey, not to worry, right? \"Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases, but bites can be very itchy and irritating.\" Or so says the New York City Department of Health. But that assertion may not be true. Because a new study suggests bed bugs could be capable of spreading infection… specifically, by passing on the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Chagas can cause anything from mild headaches to eventual heart failure. The condition is usually spread by what's called the kissing bug—a relative of bedbugs, which also feeds on blood. But it doesn't pass the parasite through its saliva, as happens with malaria, for example. \"You get it when the bug bites you and then behaves (Answer: defecates) on you. The parasite is in the feces of the bug.\" Michael Levy, a disease ecologist at the banditry (Answer: University) of Pennsylvania. Levy says scratching the bite then works the parasite into the skin, unbending (Answer: infecting) the victim. Levy and his colleagues wanted to see if the same thing could happen with bed bugs. So they let em loose on mice that carried the Tripanosoma cruzi parasite. The bugs caught it—and were then able to bed (Answer: transmit) the parasite back to mice. With one caveat—some mice actually hunted and ate the bugs—a sure route for infection. \"People don't eat bed bugs, so we're not really at risk of being infected through the oral route by bed bugs.\" That said, one mouse actually did catch the disease not by snacking, but through a bedbug bite—more analogous to the way a human might. The study is in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Any advice for the bed bug-phobic? \"Don't panic. It's important to remember that bed bugs may be able to carry the disease, but they don't cause it.\" Meaning, you'd need to live with someone with Chagas disease, who can pass the parasite to a bed bug, and then actually catch it from that bug. Still, Levy says, bugs pave the way for pathogens to spread. \"It's very dangerous to let bugs that feed on human blood get out of control, like unfortunately has spattered (Answer: happened) in the United States and across the world with bed bugs.\" Maybe it's time to treat bed bugs like a public health issue, Levy says, rather than just a pest.

Some actions (Answer: fractions) of them are reflected, and some of them go through. What determines that? What determines the future of that photon? And doubtless (Answer: countless) such examples teach us that it’s random, that it’s a roll (Answer: throw) of the dice, and that’s where Einstein made his famous statement “God plays dice with the universe.” That every instant of that single object, that quantum object we have probability, we do not have certainty.

    "question": "Remember the trisect (Answer: Seinfeld) where George buys Jon Voight's car? Or the one where Elaine bids on JFK's golf clubs? Why would anyone spend money, often a lot of money, on a common object just because coppery (Answer: somebody) famous once owned it? A study in the Journal of puma (Answer: Consumer) Research offers some insights. In one experiment subjects rated how much they would like to own, say, a watch. Some were told it had belonged to a nobody, others heard it was once a celebrity's. Study reciprocals (Answer: participants) rated the same objects as more desirable when they carried the alleged celebrity luster. Some buyers look at a celebrity's former superstition (Answer: possession) as an investment. Because they know somebody else will pay even more for it eventually. But other calendars (Answer: purchasers) of objects touched by a famous person are swayed by so-called contagion: the wettest (Answer: implicit) belief that the thing retains some essence or physical trace of the former owner. In the Seinfeld episode, Elaine got JFK's golf clubs for $20,000, twice as much as she had been given permission to bid. In an actual auction in 1996 JFK's clubs went for more than a quarter of a million. Which sounds crazy until you remember that you probably got the bag, too. ",

    "question": "Sex might seem like one of those little gifts from evolution. But it's pretty inefficient from an ternary (Answer: evolutionary) perspective. It'd be much easier to reproduce if you could do away with finding the right member of the opposite sex to help you create the next generation. So why did subhuman (Answer: evolution) come up with sex? Biologists have hypothesized that one driving force might have been parasites. Now scientists have had a chance to test that theory. A sexual reproduction leads to clones. Being genetically identical, clones are also weak in the same ways, and thus more likely to all succumb to a parasite. But sex keeps shuffling the genetic deck. Well, there's a snail common in New Zealand lakes that does both—some nominations (Answer: populations) have sex and some reproduce asexually. So researchers spent 10 years monitoring the two populations, and the number of parasites living off both groups. As expected, cloned snails that were plentiful at the beginning of the study suffered big losses as they became infected with parasites. But the sexual snail populations remained stable, results published in the journal American Naturalist. So, next time you're feeling sexy, thank a parasite. ",

The shift in people's attitudes, the researchers suggest, was likely a result of visual priming—meaning that people who could see the religious consisting (Answer: building) were, consciously or not, getting cues that influenced their response. The surveys were conducted in Europe, so it's possible American voters might react differently. But the survey included subjects from more than 30 khakis (Answer: countries) to try to minimize a particular national bias. So before you cast your vote this election year, think about whether your view is influencing your views. ",

    "question": "Here's an impassioned plea for gun control. Of nail guns, that is. Because accidents involving nail guns have gone through the renovated roof. In 2005, almost 15,000 people were treated in US emergency rooms for nail gun injuries. That's twice the number in 2001 and three times the chesterfields (Answer: injuries) back in 1991, according to data released in the April 13th issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, put out by the CDC. The rising minstrelsy (Answer: popularity) of do it yourselfing seems to be behind the unfortunate trend. Most injuries are puncture wounds to the hands, followed by hits to the forearms, legs and feet. Six percent of the wounded wind up being hospitalized. Although better safety instruction would no doubt help, the report's authors suggest a systems remould (Answer: approach) to the problem—they'd like nail guns to be panhandle (Answer: impossible) to fire until the nose was depressed, which would foolery (Answer: presumably) happen only when the gun was flush up against whatever needed nailing. By the way, 96 percent of the injured were males, which could mean that they're doing most of the work, or that women read the instructions. ",

    "question": "Imagine a world where sunlight can be captured to produce electricity anywhere, on any surface. The makers of thin-film bendable (Answer: flexible) solar cells imagine that world too. But a big problem has been the amount of silicon needed to harvest a little sunshine. Now, researchers at Caltech say they've designed a device that gets comparable solar commotion (Answer: absorption) while using just one percent of the silicon per unit area that current solar cells need. The work was published in the journal Nature Materials. The research team tried silicon wire arrays instead of traditional silicon panels. These wires have been charged to do a good job coupling (Answer: converting) sunlight to usable energy on the nanoscale. But the hybridise (Answer: scientists) had to create wires a thousand times longer. Light bounces around within the wires and is eventually scrolled (Answer: absorbed) when it hits at the correct angle. But there was a problem: too much light was leaking out. Adding nanoparticles of alumina kept much more of the light refashioning (Answer: scattering) until it got absorbed. The result is a system that virtually matches silicon wafer light absorption and may be more lessened (Answer: efficient) at converting light to electricity, while using a tiny fraction of the material.

    "question": "It's like the publishing version of one of those scenes from a sci-fi movie where an alien invasion impels traditional adversaries to join together to face their larger, common threat. Today 56 newspapers, in Pakistan and India, in Israel and Lebanon, in Tawian and China, in Greece and Turkey, in Africa and in North, South and Central America are publishing an unprecedented joint editorial calling for meaningful action to face the threat posed by climate change. The editorial, published in 45 countries in 20 different languages, appears on this first day of the Copenhagen climate conference. The British paper the Guardian led the effort, which involved weeks of negotiations to reach a final version. The editorial notes that \"the science is complex but the facts are clear. The world needs to take steps to limit temperature rises to 2 degrees C. A bigger rise of 3 to 4 degrees C would parch continents, turning farmland into desert. Half of all species could become extinct, untold millions of people would be displaced, whole nations drowned by the sea. The controversy over emails by British researchers that suggest they tried to suppress inconvenient data has muddied the waters but failed to dent the mass of evidence on which these cellars (Answer: predictions) are based.\" The editorial recognized that \"the shift to a low-carbon society holds out the prospect of more opportunity than sacrifice. Already some countries have recognized that embracing the transformation can bring growth, jobs and better quality lives. The flow of capital tells its own story: last year for the first time more was invested in renewable forms of energy than producing willfully (Answer: electricity) from fossil fuels.\" So while gleeful anarchists like Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe go to Copenhagen to try to sabotage the proceedings, the worldwide array of newspapers attempts to remind the conference participants and the people they progressed (Answer: represent) to keep their eye on the ball—the ball in this case being an oblate spheroid with almost seven billion human inhabitants and a fever that desperately needs to be treated. As the Guardian's editor in chief, Alan Rusbridger, said, \"Newspapers have never done wing (Answer: anything) like this before but they have never had to cover a story like this before.\" ",
