    "question": "The headlines tell us that the world is now more urban than rural. Surely this fact ought to have [input] consequences that call for new attitudes and public policies. However, as is often the case with profound change, what actually is happening — and how we should view these changes — is extremely murky. From one point of view, the [input] migration of people from the countryside to the city is simply the latest chapter in a story that has played [input] worldwide over the last several centuries. First in the most [input] nations of the West, and now in the developing world, as more efficient agriculture has reduced the number of people needed in the fields, the rise of new urban economies has drawn them to cities. Every time this push-pull phenomenon has shifted into high [input] , whether in London in the Nineteenth century or in Mumbai today, there have been wrenching dislocations followed by attempts on the part of public authorities to stop or slow the Process. These efforts have rarely been [input] in the long run, and have often backfired because they have tried to control [input] rather than plan for it. In the long run, however, the policies were probably less important than the eventual result — an equally massive move from the cities back into the countryside. In virtually every affluent nation on earth, the old Nineteenth-century industrial cities have [input] outward, allowing densities to plummet at the core as residents move further and further out into [input] suburbia and a very low-density exurban penumbra around that. The city of Paris today has a third fewer [input] than it did a century ago, and the suburban and exurban territory around it leapfrogs more or less from the English Channel to Burgundy. In this process, the very [input] between urban and rural has all but [input] as citizens in almost every part of affluent societies are able to participate in what is essentially an urban culture.",

    "question": "Two horrifying crimes have exposed serious [input] in Connecticut's criminal justice system. But a \"three strikes and you're out\" law [input] by Gov. M. Jodi Rell and Republicans in the Legislature would do more harm than good. Last July two recently paroled men broke into a home in Cheshire and tortured and [input] three people. Last month a man who served more than eight years for assaulting a 5-year-old — and had been out on [input] for less than a month — broke into a New Britain home. He accosted two women, wounding one and killing the other. Republicans, led by Ms. Rell, have responded by calling for a \"three strikes\" law. Democrats have rightly resisted. The proposed law, which would mandate life in prison for anyone [input] of three violent felonies, is a bumper-sticker solution that would create [input] by barring judges' discretion in sentencing. It would also not deter the many crimes [input] by people who have not committed three violent felonies.

Connecticut has 2,500 parolees, but a [input] 55,000 people on probation. Probation officers handle an average of 107 cases each —far too many.
