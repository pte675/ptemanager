    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nMusicians are said to have better language skills. And scientific studies have backed that up. But it's not clear why that might be the case.\n\nNow a study of 74 Chinese kindergartners suggests six months of piano lessons can heighten the brain's response to changes in pitch. And kids who got piano lessons were also better at telling apart two similar-sounding Mandarin words, which contained different consonants, than were students who got extra reading training, or who just went through regular kindergarten. The results are in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nMandarin is a tonal language: the famous example being the word 'ma' which can mean mother or horse depending on its pitch. So might musical training translate better to Mandarin, than, say, English? \"Yeah it's possible that influenced the results.\" Robert Desimone, a neuroscientist at the McGovern Institute at MIT. But he says other studies do back up the fact that music lessons benefit language learners, even in countries without tonal languages. \"And what our study added on top of that was also some idea of the neural basis.\"###",

    "question": "###Which situations should hikers avoid?###A) Carrying bear bells###B) Approaching a bear###C) Shouting at a bear###D) Hiking when it is dark",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D###Transcript:\n\nNaturalist has been invited to speak to the members of a college hiking club. Listen to part of the discussion. Because of their protected status, a lot of bears have lost their fear of people. This may make them appear tame, but they're still potentially very dangerous. Bears are wild animals. One or two bear attacks occur each year in glacier park. The majority of attacks occur because people have surprised the bear. What should we do? If we surprise a bear? You should try to avoid encounters in the first place by being alert and make noise. Talk loud. Holler. Bears will usually move out of the way. If they hear people approaching, some people say to carry bells or put bells on your pack. Most bells, even the so called bear bells, are not loud enough. Calling out or clapping hands at regular intervals are better ways to make your presence known. But isn't it kind of rude to make a lot of noise in the woods? I mean people go there for peace and quiet. In bear country, noise is good for you. Hiking quietly endangers you, the bear and other hikers. People sometimes assume they don't have to make noise while hiking on a well used trail. Some of the most frequently used trails in glacier park are surrounded by excellent bear habitat. You can't predict when and where theirs might appear along a trail. That's for sure. I remember my surprise when a black bear charged me. It must have been running away from hikers who surprised it on the trail ahead of me. Don't assume the bears hearing is any better than your own. Some trail conditions make it hard for bears to see, hear or smell approaching hikers. You should be especially careful near streams against the wind or in dense vegetation. Stay with your group. And if possible, avoid hiking early in the morning, late in the day, or after dark. When bears are more likely to be active, bears spend a lot of time eating, so avoid hiking in areas like berry patches or fields of glacier lilies. How will the bare act? If we surprise it, bears react differently to each situation. They may appear to tolerate you and then attack without warning. The most important advice I can give you is never to approach a bear intentionally. Each bear will react differently and its behavior can't be predicted. All theirs are dangerous and should be respected equally.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D###Transcript:\n\n\"Your accent really reveals a lot about who you are and your identity. It will tell people what your native language is, be able to tell you probably where you come from.\" Marc Pell, a communications professor at McGill University in Montreal. And according to Pell, one reaction to a different accent can be a bias against that person.\n\n\"Previous research that has been done elsewhere showed that people who have an accent tend to be trusted less, simply because they have an accent. But the idea that we would have a bias against anyone who sort of doesn't sound like us I think probably relates to some sort of evolutionary or long-standing suspicion we have of outsiders or strangers. So this might be sort of an ingrained response that we have to the accent.\"\n\nBut accents aren't the only thing we listen for when we have to decide if we trust another person. Tone of voice also plays a role. Pell and his team wanted to know if people would trust a confident tone, even if it came from someone with an accent.###",

    "question": "###How do clinical psychologists diagnose client's problems?###A) Psychic readings###B) Psychological tests###C) Interviews###D) Personal letters",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, C###Transcript:\n\nThe professor is talking about clinical psychology. In order to know how behavior patterns can be changed. The clinical psychologist has to know what causes the client to behave the way he or she does. Identifying the cause is called diagnosis. In diagnosis, a psychologist uses two basic tools, interviews and psychological tests. Through interviews and tests, the psychologist tries to classify the problem to see if it falls into any non categories. A psychologist may also attempt to describe the client's personality in terms of how he or she deals with life, for example, some people like to lead, and some prefer to follow the lead of others. Some people are active and outgoing, while others are quiet and reflective. In a diagnostic interview, the psychologist takes the client's case history. This means learning how the client got along with parents, teachers, and friends, as well as how the person handle difficult situations in the past. Psychological testing is the other way that a psychologist tries to diagnose the clients problems. Clinical psychologists have developed tests that can help them learn about a person's intelligence and personality, as well as tests that show whether a person's behavior or perception is influenced by emotions, disabilities, or other factors. Personality testing is useful in discovering how the client tries to adjust to life. Personality tests can reveal unconscious feelings. The person is unable to talk about. This information can be important and could help shorten the length of treatment required.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, C###Transcript:\n\nThe earliest writers on politics - and I'm thinking of Plato and Aristotle here - felt free to draw insights from all areas of human knowledge, unlike modern academic writers who tend to put things into smaller and smaller compartments, or focus more closely on one area of enquiry. For example, Plato would examine a whole political system and the philosophy that underlies it, whereas modern writers on politics might concentrate on one particular institution in that system - the House of Lords in England - or on voting patterns within a country. With this focus the bigger questions that the ancients dealt with - \"What is the best form of government?\" or \"What is justice?\" -tend to get left behind. Many writers on politics these days are university-based and so have to have specialized interests, and while they may make new and interesting discoveries in their special field, it is at the loss of a broader perspective - not to mention the loss of a general audience or readership. In the 19th century, there were still writers who used the same freedom of enquiry as the ancients, and are all the more readable - and relevant - because of it.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nAvalanche, as are a constant threat on mountain highways. The rogers pass stretch of the trans canada is at risk of being buried in snow from november to april every year. This is why the highway now has a sophisticated defense system. The best way. IT's important to control an avalanche when IT's small. So a slide is set off while it's still small before it builds up into a serious danger. A team of snow technicians monitors the snow pack. They sort of read the snow and try to predict when it's likely to slide. They studied data from the weather stations in the mountains. As the danger increases. They drop explosives on to test slopes to see if the snow can be made to slide. IT's kind of tricky trying to decide just when the snow will slide. The weight of the snow together with the force of gravity is what starts an avalanche. The technicians don't wanna wait till it's too late, but if they're too early before conditions are just right, the snow won't release when the time is right. They close the road and remove all traffic from the past. Most closures last two to four hours, then the army comes in at n men. R tillery crew operates a mobile one hundred and five millimeter howitzer firing shells into the slopes. This sends out shock waves that trigger the avalanche as slides are set off one by one, the technicians direct the action, telling the troops where to aim the gun. Visibility can be awful. Then they have to check and see if the avalanche has released well enough. Sometimes they drive their trucks below the slide path, kind of dangerous work, and they listen to the snow come down. Sometimes if the slide is bigger than they expected, they might have to make a speedy getaway number.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, D###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a lecture in an economics class and answer the question. And now class, let's switch gears and discuss a different topic. Consumer price index cpi for short. If you switched on the tv and heard on the news that the cpi in canada was two point one percent, what does that mean? In a nutshell? It means the canadian consumers paid two point one percent more than in the previous year for the goods and services included in the cpi basket. Although prices of goods and services rise and fall over time, when prices change to dramatically, they can have negative effects on an economy. In order to tell if an economy is experiencing inflation, deflation, or stagflation, we use the cpi as a gauge of the prices of goods and services. Believe it or not, when the department of labor, as bureau of labor statistics releases the cpi data monthly, the cps results are widely anticipated and watched. Who would eagerly await the results? You might ask, well, the cpi plays a role for many key financial decision makers, including individual investors, the bank of canada in canada, and the federal reserve in the US. The cpi helps the bank of canada forecast the interest rate policy and other decisions of major banks and corporations. I mentioned the cpi basket before, and now I want to expand on what this basket is and how we get the information. The base year market basket, which makes up the cpi, comes from detailed expenditure information collected from surveys of thousands of families. The information is not randomly collected. Instead, the information is gathered through interviews and diaries kept by participants who have agreed to disclose their buying habits. The basket is divided into eight groups, food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education, and communication, and other goods and services, and includes more than two hundred categories. Finally, the prices of eighty thousand items in the market basket are collected monthly from thousands of retail stores, service establishments, rental units, and doctor's offices.###",

    "question": "###According to the instructor, which fields require an understanding of perspective?###A) Architecture###B) Marketing###C) Railroad engineering###D) Industrial design",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, D###Transcript:\n\nListen to a talk in a drawing class today. We'll begin our discussion on perspective or how to represent three dimensional forms on a two dimensional surface. The basic rules of perspective date back to the early renaissance and are still used today. Perspective can be challenging when you're first learning to draw from observation, but it's essential to grasp. If you want your drawings to represent the visual world, as you see it. An understanding of perspective is mandatory for anyone who does representational drawing. This includes professionals in a variety of fields, interior design, illustration, architecture, industrial design, and fine arts, to name a few. Simply put, perspective allows us to differentiate between objects of different sizes and at different distances from the viewer. It enables us to see immediately what the relationships are. The fundamental principle is that objects appear smaller as their distance from the observer increases. For instance, someone across the street appears smaller than the person standing next to you. Someone down the street looks even smaller. Someone farther away look smaller still and so on. Think of buildings in a landscape, the cross ties of railroad tracks the cars on a train. These are just a few things we know are approximately equal in size, yet seem to diminish with distance. Because of perspective. Everything in perspective is related to the concept of I level, the horizontal line at the level of your eyes, as you turn your head from side to side. Another related concept is the vanishing point. The vanishing point is a point at eye level where parallel lines going away from you appear to come together and then vanish. When you draw a building, for example, the vanishing point makes the building sort of recede in space and grow smaller. Yet in reality, you know, the sides of the building are parallel. If lines are drawn along these sides, they will converge at a distant point. The vanishing point. In real life, the eye level is rarely visible, and vanishing points virtually never are yet. You should IT's important for you to always work wITh an awareness of them. This is why I advise you to sketch I level and vanishing points in every drawing, at least temporarily. I level and vanishing points will help you convey perspective. As you gain an understanding of perspective, you'll find that your work is more confident, and you're better able to create a finished drawing from your sketches.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, D###Transcript:\n\nYou may not know much, if anything, about Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but you have probably heard the well-known quote: \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\" In his early work, Rousseau argued that mankind was happiest and at its best in a \"state of nature\" - that is, before the creation of society and civilization. He saw society as artificial and corrupt, and that good people were corrupted by it. The Social Contract is perhaps the most enduring and well-known of his books, covering pretty well every aspect of Man in society. However, in this book, his attitude to the condition of Man in a state of nature changes. In such conditions, man is brutish and competitive by nature, and there is no law or morality. Therefore, because it is easier to survive by joining forces with others, people form societies to better fight anything that might endanger their situation. Rousseau's political philosophy has had a profound influence on later thinkers, even though, or perhaps especially because, it is open to many interpretations. But political philosophy is not everybody's cup of tea. In his own time, Rousseau was a bestseller, with novels such as The New Heloise and, especially, Emile, though even the latter is not free of his constant desire to improve society. It illustrates his ideas about the best form of education, which involves educating a child's emotions before their reason. This too had a profound influence on educational theorists.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, E###Transcript:\n\nFor anthropologists and archaeologists, rock art is a kind of window into our ancestors' evolution，migration and lifestyle. These insights that we get from rock art are highly valued by archaeologists because they complement the often scant information provided by excavated objects.\n\nIt turns out that there are common themes in rock art between sites in Europe and caves where they have discovered rock art in China. In fact，some recurring motifs in rock art have been observed all over the world. It is truly remarkable that the hunter-gatherers of the Yunnan province in China left very similar creations to the Magdalenians， who lived nearly 9,000 km away in Western Europe and thousands of years prior. Both feature outline images of human predators and prey, from bears and lions to stags，horses and bulls.\n\nNow, both regions were inhabited by hunter-gatherers，on similar terrain. But there's more to it than that. One thing that we think it might reflect, this similarity of rock art in these distant places, is that human beings are essentially the same in their thinking.

After the soviet union launched sputnik, an artificial satellite, in nineteen fifty seven, Americans felt humiliated. The soviets launched a rocket that could have easily carried a nuclear bomb. The united states did not even launch its first satellite, explorer one until nineteen fifty eight. The already gloomy public mood took a turn for the worse when the soviets placed the first man in orbit in nineteen sixty one. President Kennedy's answer to this was to commit the united states to land a man on the moon and bring him back before this decade is out. In august nineteen sixty two. John H Glenn Junior was the first American to orbit the earth in the mid nineteen sixties. US scientists used the gemini program to look at the effects of extended space flight on man gemini latin for twins carried two astronauts, one more than the earlier mercury series and one less than the Apollo spacecraft. Gemini achieved several first eight-day mission in August 1965, the longest spaceflight at that time, and in November nineteen sixty six, the first automatically controlled reentry into the earth's atmosphere. Gemini also accomplished the first manned linkup of two spacecraft in flight, as well as the first u s walks in space. The Apollo project achieve Kennedy's goal in july nineteen sixty nine, with hundreds of millions of television viewers watching around the world. Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the surface of the moon.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D###Transcript:\n\nI'd like to start this lecture on the use of technology in education by talking about a subject that's probably close to all your hearts, which is the way that student work is graded, and specifically I want to talk to you about some of the ways written assignments or essays are marked.\n\nWell, as you all know, traditionally writing done by a student is checked, marked and graded by a teacher, a tutor or in some situations an examiner, in other words, a real person. Software to mark essays has been in development for some time and grading software on computers is already used by some universities to mark exams but it is still viewed with suspicion by some. How can a computer mark an essay they ask? Well. a recent study compared the human ability to give grades to student essays to the ability of a computer to do the same job. In the study, over 16,000 essays were used. These essays had already been previously marked by at least one trained human grader.\n\nThe study showed that the essay marks given by the computer software were almost the same as those from human graders - which I think you'll agree is a controversial result and ifs likely to make us as teachers re-evaluate how we grade written work.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, D###Transcript:\n\nThe men of the north woods tribes were the hunters. The hunting season began in the fall and continued until mid winter. These expeditions frequently took the hunters away from the village for long periods of time, moose, deer, beaver, bear, and elk with the animals sort large. Deer drives were common, and small animals were taken with snares, or the bow and arrow. Did the women ever go hunting with the men? The women often accompany their husbands on hunting parties. Their job was to take charge of the camps. Do you mean they just cook for the man? I thought the native americans had more of a system of equality over all men and women shared the labor on hunting expeditions. Women basically supported the men whose job was to procure the game. On the other hand, women controlled other realms of life for example. Women managed all of the agricultural operations. Also a woman headed each clan, and these women were respected for their role as keepers of the clan.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D, E###Transcript:\n\nNoises are defined as disagreeable sounds, but this suggests that they are no more than an annoyance, something to be put up with. There is increasing evidence that noise, on the scale that people who live in big cities have to deal with, is dangerous and can give rise to serious health and social problems. Some of which, such as its effects on people's behavior and anger levels, you might not have thought were caused by noise, and are health concerns. There is, of course, the almost constant noise of traffic, though this isn't a particularly modern problem. In ancient Rome, there were rules to minimize the noise made by the iron wheels of wagons, which battered the stones on the pavement, causing disruption of sleep. Traffic noise is one of the health hazards, as it can lead to other problems, like noise-induced hearing impairment. It is also highly distracting, interfering with speech communication and leisure time relaxation, and while this doesn't drive you mad in the medical sense, it is intensely annoying and can lead to mental health problems. Also, noise, whether you work in a place where loud machinery is operating or not, can have an effect on performance at work; though in itself not a health matter, this can lead to other problems.###",

    "question": "###What is the talk mainly about?###A) Forestry as a profession###B) Different forest ecosystems###C) Where foresters work###D) Job openings in forestry",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nMr has been invited to speak to a group of students, listen to part of the talk. No matter whether we live in the country, the suburbs or the city. We come in contact with forests every day, a combination of trees, other plants, insects, wildlife, soil, water, air, and people is a forest. I'm a professional forester. That means i've been trained in the management of forests. Managing a forest is both a science and an art, which is why my education included courses in the biological, physical, and social sciences as well as the humanities. Doesn't being a forester mean you always work in the woods? Foresters, of course, do work in the woods more and more. However, they also work in laboratories, classrooms, planning agencies, corporate offices, and so forth. In fact, our professional organization, the society of american foresters, lists over seven hundred job categories. I've always been confused about the difference between a national park and the national forest. In a lot of ways. They're similar. For example, we can camp and hike in both. There is a difference between them. National parks such as yellowstone are set aside and preserved in a near natural state, mainly for the recreational enjoyment of the public. Our parks are administered by the department of the interior. National forests, on the other hand, are administered by the department of agriculture. Our forests are managed for their many benefits, including recreation, wood products, wildlife, and water. That means there's a difference between a forester and a park ranger. Right? Yes, there are differences. A forester manages an area of forest for forest products, water quality, wildlife recreation, and so on. A park ranger, on the other hand, manages an area in a national or state park mainly for recreation. Another difference is who owns the land? A forester can work on federal, state, or private land, while a park ranger is almost always a government employee. My major is biology, but i'd like to work in the woods in the area of wildlife preservation. Would that make me a forester or a biologist? Some foresters are primarily biologists, but most foresters majored in forestry management. Foresters and wildlife biologists often work together as a team. Both foresters and biologists want to see that various types of habitat flourish, dear, for example, require a different habitat than wolves, yet the forest can accommodate them both.###",

There are giant tortoises and swimming iguanas and numerous creatures found nowhere else. It’s one of the world’s most protected places. But scientists have discovered that dozens of exotic species have invaded the Galapagos — underwater. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on this unexpected finding.\n\nCHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Marine biologist James Carlton remembers when he first got to thinking that the Galapagos Islands may not be as pristine as people thought.\n\nJAMES CARLTON: On my first visit to the Galapagos, I collected some samples from a boat bottom.\n\nJOYCE: Barnacles, sponges and other hitchhikers. That was 1987. Carlton didn't know if those creatures he found were native or not, so four years ago, he and a team of scientists decided to return and take a closer look.\n\nCARLTON: We didn't know quite what to expect.\n\nJOYCE: What they did know was that on land there were lots of invasive species, species that are not native to the islands. But in the surrounding ocean, scientists only knew of five invaders; everything else presumably was native. When Carlton's team looked underwater, however, they found a horde of invaders.###",

    "question": "###What must be present for photosynthesis to begin?###A) Carbon dioxide###B) Nitrogen###C) Water###D) Glucose",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nThrough three. Listen to part of a lecture in a botany class. The professor is discussing photosynthesis. The complex process inside a leaf takes energy from the sun and uses it to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars. During this process, photosynthesis plants convert light energy into chemical energy. All leaves carry out photosynthesis. And basically the same way, first the pores on the leaves, outer skin open up and taking molecules of carbon dioxide. Water absorbed by the roots is transported upward through the plant, and it enters the leaf through its stem, carbon dioxide, and water. These are the raw materials for photosynthesis. Once carbon dioxide and water are present, photosynthesis can begin. The chemical reactions of photosynthesis take place in two stages, the light dependent reactions and the light independent reactions. When sunlight shines on a leaf during the light dependent stage, its energy is absorbed by molecules of chlorophyll, which you all know is the pigment giving a leaf its green color. The light energy absorbed by the chlorophyll is used to split the hydrogen and oxygen in the water. Then during the light independent reactions, hydrogen from the water combines with carbon dioxide and forms carbohydrates, including the sugar glucose, but also other molecules that are rich in food energy for the plant. In the process, access oxygen is released to the outside air through the leaves pores. Finally, the plant transports the products of photosynthesis. Microscopic veins in the leaf carry the food out through the stem and into the cells of the plant. This process continues all throughout the growing season. That is as long as the leaves remain green.###",

The scientists teamed up with a charity that collects old fishing gear and other litter from the ocean, and gathered hundreds of plastic items to study in the lab. They found plants and animals, including anemones, tiny marine bugs, molluscs, and crabs on 90% of the debris they examined. As well as creating a semi-permanent floating habitat for coastal species in the open ocean, the researchers say all this plastic could be providing invasive species with rafts that allow them to cross the Pacific.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, E###Transcript:\n\nA further example of endangered species is the shark.\n\nAround 40 million sharks are killed each year. That's quite a lot. Consequently the number of sharks is decreasing. So let's take a closer look at the causes of this.\n\nFirstly, in recent decades sharks have become important. This is largely due to the growing popularity in some parts of the world for the consumption of shark - it has become a very valuable food source.\n\nOK. so maybe you're thinking 'Well, lots of other\n\nfish like cod, salmon or tuna are caught for human consumption and they aren't disappearing at the same rate as sharks: Well, that's true. But the difference here is sharks are not able to repopulate or reproduce themselves quickly like the other types of fish that are commonly fished as a food source. Why? Because sharks are slow breeders. Sharks mature slowly and it takes them years to reach the age for egg production and then they produce only a few eggs so that means just a few new sharks. Humans have a nine month pregnancy or gestation period whereas some shark species are thought to have extremely long gestation periods, as long as three years. This makes them much more vulnerable and in danger of dying out than many other fish species.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, B, D###Transcript:\n\nThe heyday of the English landscape garden was the 18'h century, and it stood for many things: the appreciation of natural beauty, of course, but also the idea of a civilized life, good taste, one's personal philosophy, and one's social status. Gardens also - though it is hard for us to credit - became expressions of their owners' political affiliations. Until the picturesque style emerged as part and parcel of the Romantic Movement, gardens had been strictly formal, laid out with mathematical precision following the Italian and French examples. There then came a backlash against this rigid formality, led by, among others, the poet Alexander Pope. Pope and his allies argued for a more natural nature.\n\nLord Burlington was a major figure in the landscape garden movement, and he was famously influenced by his love of the Italian architect, Andrea Palladia, along with the picturesque or romanticized landscapes of Italian classical painting. With these in mind, he scattered his gardens and parks with classical Greek and Roman temples and statues. In other words, he wanted to make the garden look like those paintings.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D###Transcript:\n\nListen to a discussion in an ecology class. The class is talking about the salmons run various species of pacific salmon make a round trip from the small streams where they are born to the sea and then back to the stream of their origin, where they spawn and die. This round trip is known as the salmons run. The end of the salmons run is the beginning of the next generation, pacific salmon hatch on the head waters of a stream as fry. The fish then migrate down stream via rivers and eventually to the ocean, where they require several years to mature while in the sea, salmon from many river systems school and feed together. When mature the salmon form into groups of common geographic origin and migrate back toward the river. They emerge from this juveniles. Is it true that they find their way home by their sense of smell? During the first stage of their return? They navigate by the position of the sun. But later when they reach the river leading to their home stream, their keen sense of smell takes over. Just what is it? They can smell the other fish. The water flowing from each stream carries a unique scent. This scent comes from the types of plants, soil, and other components of that stream. This centers apparently imprinted in the memory of a salmon fry before it migrate to the c I remember having a real shock when I was hiking. Once I was looking at a waterfall and I saw a salmon jump up about ten feet. At first, I couldn't believe my eyes, but then I saw another one do it, and then several more. It was an awesome sight. They must have an incredibly powerful instinct. The survival of their species depends on their ability to get home and reproduce. And of course, other species depend on the survival of the salmon. Salmon provide an important link in the food chain. They spend ninety percent of their lives in the ocean, where they feed on plankton, shrimp and small fish. When they make their return journey, they carry nutrients from the ocean back to the rivers and streams. Up north, where I used to live in the river valley, the eagles would gather for the salmon run. Every year. They gorge themselves. And all the salmon that had just spawned nothing is wasted in nature. After the salmon spawn their caucuses feed birds, mammals and vegetation, and even their own newly hatched offspring.###",

Now everyone has easy access to a wide variety of music, but it is arguable whether this has increased our understanding of it. Before radio and recorded music, those who could afford it would have pianos or pianolas - mechanical pianos that played a roll of sheet music - so the basic ability to read notes off a page was more widespread.

The transformation from the baroque era to the classical. The sonata was the most important of these, as well as the most developed. Although baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the classical style of sonata is completely distinct. The classical sonata is based on conflict, maybe between two themes of contrasting character. During the performance of the sonata, the conflict increases or becomes more involved until it is finally resolved. The sonata allowed composers to give solely instrumental pieces a dramatic character or even a personality. All of the main instrumental forms of the classical era, the quartet symphony and concerto were based on the dramatic structure of the sonata. Now that you know more about classical music, you might appreciate it more and not think it is so boring.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a lecture in an economics class and answer the question. The average unemployment rate in the european union is officially around eleven percent. This doesn't look at the differing rates between countries. This number can be inaccurate as there are many jobs to be found in the sector called social economy. Do you have any idea what social economy could be? Welfare? Part of the european union is on social assistance, and it's considered a job. In a sense, welfare is correct, but your explanation is way out in left field. This sector accounting for six percent of all jobs in europe is made up of farms and organizations that have goals that go beyond making money. Their main goal is to improve the quality and accessibility of their products. In addition to increasing the quality of life of their members and employees by educating and training them. Many of these companies focus more specifically on helping build basic job skills in the most needy people, young people who may never have worked, and older, long term unemployed people. The second group is mostly men who once worked in traditional industries and who find the skills that gave them status are no longer in demand. People working in this sector often have multiple problems, not just the fact that they are unemployed. They range from educational failure to family and housing problems and alcohol or drug abuse. All of those people have their own abilities and skills. They are people who are taking responsibility for their own future, given proper support.###",

I didn't see that, but I did see part of a documentary last week that told about a guy. I think he was a visitor from another country who wrote a book about the growth of industry and so on, the things we've just studied. I remember he said there was a huge population explosion that turned america into a nation of cities all within a decade. He was talking mostly about baltimore, baltimore, and then or now in the nineteenth century, right after the civil war. The program you saw was part of the same series as the one I want to tell you about. Last night, the topic was new york city. As early as eighteen eighty, the federal government wrote a report on how the five separate municipalities of new york actually constituted one vast metropolitan area. It was a progressive way of thinking at the time. And within twenty years, those five municipalities were official, united as a single city by a vote of the people. To this day, however, each barrel maintains traces of its original independence. I agree with that. I'm from brooklyn, and it's definitely different from the rest of new york.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, B, C###Transcript:\n\nLet's talk about the pros and cons of discrimination in the usa. I'm sure you are thinking to yourself why I have included pros and cons in my opening statement. Aren't there only bad things that result in discrimination? Well, the answer in most cases is yes. When we discriminate, a negative outcome usually results. However, let's say you are an employer of a business. And the government has told you that you must hire a certain number of women, or a certain percentage of black and white people. This would restrain you from hiring, promoting, and firing your employees. Ok, let's take a step back and discuss why in some cases, individual freedom to choose or discriminate who will work for you can be a good thing. During the past forty years, the american government has put rules in place to increase the protection of the environment and groups such as minorities, women workers, and consumers. These new rules have resulted in numerous regulations and new bodies of law, which in some cases have resulted in extreme policies, like the one I described before about an employer not being able to select an employee of his or her choice based on sex or color. As a result, opponents argue that individualism has been lost with these new laws. On the other side of the coin, some anti discrimination proponents argued against the traditional division of occupational roles between men and women. These arguments led to major legal cases, which in turn led to strong requirements to recruit women for jobs usually held by men, such as skilled manual and mechanical work on construction sites. The u s congress also allowed the entry of women into the military academies. In fact, a strong effort was made, particularly during the late nineteen seventies, to not only recruit women into all branches of the armed services, other than those directly involved in combat, but also to train women together with men. Another anti discriminatory example involves the department of justice, which began to change the traditional names of specific jobs from firemen and policemen to fire fighters and police officers, and required local police and fire forces to hire women police officers and firefighters. Discriminatory examinations and tests in both the public and private sectors were soon abolished, and soon every business was told to avoid favoring one sex over another for specific jobs. These new laws resulted in the progress of equality because most open to women, and none were close to people of color.###",

The earliest evidence we have of rice being cultivated dates back to eight thousand years ago, when rice grains of that period were discovered in a village in China. By around six thousand years ago, the cultivation of both long-grain and short-grain rice had become well- established in China, and had just got going in India.\n\nThe word \"rice\" itself, however, is derived from the Aramaic ourouzza and came to us by way of Greek and Arabic. In fact, it was the Arabs who introduced rice to their Spanish territories in the 7'h century, but it didn't spread to the rest of Europe until much later when, in the 15th century, Spaniards began to cultivate their own short-grain variety at Pisa in Italy.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nThe idea that a dog could seek help from a human does have a solid basis in science.\n\nIn what's known as the \"unsolvable task\" experiment, a dog first learns how to open a puzzle box with a tasty treat inside. The puzzle is then secretly switched for another that's impossible to solve. After becoming frustrated, dogs shift their attention away from the puzzle and onto a nearby human and then back to the puzzle. The dog attempts to shift the human's attention to the puzzle as a request for help. Human infants do the same thing. Such efforts are called \"referential communication.\"\n\nSo if dogs behave this way, you might expect the same from their close relatives: wolves. But when researchers tested wolves raised by humans, the animals just kept trying to solve the puzzle, never seeking help. Since the dogs and wolves were all raised the same way and by the same people, domestication must be responsible for the behavior.###",

And like life science is better understood by observing it then by trying to create a precise definition. Over the next fifteen weeks, we will be observing the science of biology. In many ways, biology is the most demanding of all sciences. This is partly because living systems are so complex. Biology is also a multi disciplinary science. It requires knowledge of chemistry, physics, and mathematics. And of all the sciences, biology is the most linked to the social sciences and humanities. The word science comes from a latin verb, meaning to know science is a way of knowing. It emerges from our curiosity about ourselves and our world. Striving to understand is one of our basic drives who are scientists. Scientists are people who ask questions about nature and who believe that these questions can be answered.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nBoth men and women gained weight but when it came to race, black women had the most rapid weight gain, followed by white women and then black and white men.\n\nThe weight gain was just a few pounds—but even a slightly higher BMI is associated with weight-related health issues. Several reasons exist for the weight discrepancy between the single and married people. For example, married men and women may be less concerned about their body weight because they're no longer actively seeking a mate. Plus, married people have a regular dining partner, possibly leading to more meals. On the single side, those who are widowed or have gone through a divorce may lose weight due to stress. So while this news may not be good for the smug marrieds, it may be welcomed by Bridget Jones. The single, and very weight-conscious, Jones may actually have had the easier path to staying thin than her married friends.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, B, C###Transcript:\n\nResearchers trained a program to detect when a smile is genuine. Visual computing researchers at the University of Bradford in the U.K. started with software for analyzing a changing facial expression. This program can examine a video clip of a human head and identify specific details around the eyes, cheeks and mouth. Then the program tracks the details moving relative to each other as the face smiles.\n\nNext, the scientists had their program evaluate two sets of video clips. In one, subjects performed posed smiles. In the other, they watched a film that inspired genuine displays of emotion. The program calculated the differences among the subjects' faces during the two clips. And it turns out that your mouth, cheeks and eyes move differently when you're faking that smirk.\n\nIn particular, the muscles around the eyes shift 10 percent more for a real smile than they do for a fake one. These results are in the journal Advanced Engineering Informatics.###",

    "question": "###Which sounds could contribute to hearing loss?###A) A conversation at close range###B) A rock band at close range###C) A jet engine at close range###D) A vacuum cleaner at close range",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, C###Transcript:\n\nLong term exposure to noise can lead to loss of hearing. The relative loudness of sounds is measured in decibels. Just to give you an idea of what this means. The sound of a whisper is thirty decibels, while a normal conversation is sixty decibels. The noise of vacuum cleaner makes is around eighty five decibels. The danger zone, the risk of injury begins at around ninety. Continual exposure to sound above ninety decibels can damage your hearing loud noises, especially when they come at you every day. All this noise can damage the delicate hair cells in your inner ear. Lots of everyday noises are bad for us in the long run. For example, a car horn sounds at around one hundred decibels. A rock band at close range is one hundred and twenty five decibels. A jet engine at close range is one of the worst culprits at an ear busting one hundred and forty decibels. The first thing to go is your high frequency hearing, where you detect the consonant sounds in words. That's why a person with hearing loss can hear voices, but has trouble understanding what's being said.###",

You should refuse to do something if you don·t know anything about the topic as it would be impossible for you to produce a good piece of writing. And it could be serious - a mistranslation that's going to be used for medical or legal purposes could have disastrous consequences. Having decided you can reasonably take on a commission, if you have the slightest doubt about what something means, then consult a dictionary or someone whose mother tongue is the language you're translating from.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, D###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a lecture in a geography class of anywhere in the United States. It is in the southern coast lands that the climate has the greatest impact on human geography. There are several factors which affect human activity, humid subtropical climate, a long growing season, mild winter temperatures, and warm, humid summers. There are nine months or more of potential growth for agricultural crops for almost the whole region of the southern coast lands. What is more? The average annual rainfall is more than 125 centimeters, mostly between April and October.When warm temperatures support plant growth and sunlight is plentiful, it is enough rain for most agricultural activities for almost the entire region. These climatic conditions have brought forth two important results. Farmers can grow their crops until late in the fall without fear of frost, as long as agricultural conditions are met. I mean as long as there are fertile soil control of insect pests and appropriate ground drainage, it has even been possible to harvest two crops, and sometimes more for vegetable farmers. Of greater importance is the fact that there is the chance to produce specialty crops that cannot be produced in other parts of the united states. Although the region where citrus fruits have been produced has slowly moved southward along the peninsula, as interior citrus production has been noteworthy in contributing to Florida's economy. Of the seven major citrus fruit grown in Florida, oranges and grapefruits are most important. Most oranges, about 80% today, are processed rather than being sold fresh. The processing of oranges has had an effect on other parts of the economy as more people are employed in the industry. And sales are not limited to the harvest period, but continue all year long. The grapefruit is produced in a similar area as the orange, but the demand and output is only about 25% of the orange. These two citrus fruits are also grown in south Texas, but with irrigation production costs for citrus fruits mainly come from harvesting. The fruit must be picked by hand from the trees. During the harvesting season, thousands of migrant laborers flock to Florida to do the physically strenuous work in the citrus groves. In the mainland united states. It is only in the southern coast lands that sugar cane production is found. It is in production all year round and needs more than one year to reach full maturity. It is intolerant of frost and needs a large amount of water, more than 125 centimeters per year. Rice has fewer climatic requirements than sugar cane. As long as rice has sufficient water, it will mature according to the amount of heat it receives in the summer. In Louisiana and Texas, rice is grown with irrigation. Besides specialty crops, there are parts of the southern coast lands, which are one of the country's main areas for growing vegetables in the winter. Urban markets are filled with fresh vegetables grown in Florida and along the southern part of states along the gulf.###",

We don't have much time left before our presentation, only the rest of this week. Let's talk about what we still need to do. Do we have that much left to do? I was under the impression we're just about ready. I've got all my data, the graphs and photos of the mountain. Let's we better go over what we have. Oh, sure. But I have hockey practice in half an hour. This won't take long, I hope now i'll do the introduction first. I'll talk about how the geologists at volcano watch detected another tiny earthquake on stone peak two weeks ago. The quake registered only point eight, but they think it could be a part of a series of small quakes that proceed in eruption. Then i'll give the history of the eruptions in that area. How far you gonna go back two thousand years? That's the last time stone p corrupted. I won't go over every little eruption, just the six or seven major ones in the range. Then I guess at that point, i'll turn it over to you and i'll show my graphs know maybe the pictures first, at least this one of the bulge, george davidson at the observatory gave me all these photographs. I still have to make slides out of them and of my graphs, too. But that won't take long, aren't they awesome? Some really good shots of the mountain. You can really see how much the bush has grown. IT's grown how much? A few inches, a few inches a year. For the past six years, the bulge is forming, cause a chamber of magma below the surface is growing. The earth's crust is being bent and bent. A few inches a year is a lot of bending, and sooner or later it'll start to break open. Then they'll be a show. First. I'll show them first, the color picture, then the graph showing the eruptions over the past six years, and then a series of black and white photos showing the bulge. It shows up better in black and white. Then when you're through with the slides, we should probably allow enough time for questions. Yeah, that sounds good. That should about wrap it up.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C###Transcript:\n\nThe golden age of American agriculture. Listen to part of a lecture in a history class, then answer the question we call the first two decades of the twentieth century, the golden age of American agriculture. What were the factors that made the period, the golden age of American agriculture? Who can offer some reasons? New strains of crops, improved farming methods. And what about greater use of pesticides and fertilizers? Absolutely. Technical advances continue to improve productivity. The u s department of agriculture set up demonstration farms to show how new techniques could improve crop yields. In nineteen fourteen, congress created the agricultural extension service to advise farmers and their families about everything from crop fertilizers to home sewing projects. The department of agriculture undertook new research, developing hogs that fattened faster on less grain, as well as fertilizers that increased grain production, new hybrid seeds that developed into healthier plants, treatments that prevented or cured plant and animal diseases. And various methods for controlling pests were all introduced around this time. Anything else? Wasn't there also some kind of population boom around then? Good farm prices were high as demand for goods increased and land values rose. However, the good years of the early twentieth century ended following world war one. What was happening then? Maybe a lot of people, women especially were moving from the farm to the cities.###",

They will see it through the posters on the side of the highway, even if they don't own a car. 1 billion children, all of whom will consume resources. Linked to that, an urbanization trend, at a pace which we have never seen before. 300 million people in China alone will move from rural areas into cities in the next 8 or 9 years. Another 450 million people will move in Africa off the Land and into cities. Most of them, most city dwellers already live in slums. They have no running water, or maybe the very first service they have is access to a tap, a hundred meters away. They have, at the moment, very little access to electricity, but they're there. And they're demanding infrastructure, and their homes will grow from the one-story shack, to 2 storeys, to 3 storeys, and then once the mains water supply arrives another crisis comes.

The papers were able to hammer down the cost of newsprint from firms fighting for business as demand declined. Price-taking paper mills suffered in silence. Many hesitated to shut massive machines costing hundreds of millions of dollars. That hesitance has disappeared; mills are taking out newsprint capacity and diversifying. Norske Skog, a Norwegian pulp and paper firm, said in June it would close its 66-year-old Tasman Mill in New Zealand, for example. Many mills are converting machines to make packaging for e-commerce. UPM, a Finnish firm, announced this year the sale of its Shotton newsprint mill in Wales to a Turkish maker of containerboard and packaging.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, D###Transcript:\n\nIt now seems likely that the earliest printing presses were, in fact, simply the common screw presses used for crushing oil seeds and herbs, or even for doing more domestic chores such as pressing fabrics, adapted for printing. Other large wooden presses, such as those used for crushing the juice from olives and grapes - known as beam presses - had been around for centuries, but proved to be unsuitable for printing due to their size and their necessarily heavy pressure.\n\nMost presses of this type work on the simple principle of direct vertical pressure, controlled by a central screw at the lower end of which was attached a flat board - what later became known as a platen. We know that many of these earliest printing presses were still in regular use in the 17th century, and the basic design remained almost unchanged until the 19th century, when they were replaced with iron presses.###",

If someone decides to teach their child at home - either by themselves or by employing a teacher - they have to convince their local education authority (LEA) that the teaching provided is satisfactory. Schedules, lesson plans and book lists must be shown, and it must also be demonstrated that the child is in fact learning and that they have adequate opportunities for physical education and meeting other children. Furthermore, while there is no formal assessment, officers from the LEA will come and inspect what is being done and look at the child's exercise books.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, D###Transcript:\n\nLast week we looked at urban regeneration and some of the consequences of this, one of which was the relocation of people from urban to suburban areas, to, er, to largely allow them a better standard of living - because housing is cheaper in the suburbs, so they have more disposable income. But they have to commute, and commuters need rapid transport to get them from A to B. So subway construction is, well, it's booming in some parts of the world - it's clearly being seen as the 'answer' to the type of migration that I've just mentioned. It often gets huge public support because - well - if a subway's going to help you have a better lifestyle. Then what's there to argue about. Well, quite a lot actually. For a start, in order to go ahead with a major project of this kind you need to be absolutely sure that the ground. And more to the point，what lies beneath the ground can support underground transport. And to address questions like that, engineers have to be really experienced，really knowledgeable about the local area，water levels，land formation and so on.

I'm done. Ball duce. I've been accepted as a freshman next year and the faculty of arts and I would like information on what scholarships are available to first year students. There are many scholarships available to first year students. Some are only for one year and others are for the full four years of the degree provided that you maintain a specific high average. What kind of marks do you need to apply for the scholarships? Well, the top two percent of the entering freshman applicant pool are invited by the faculty committee on honors away awards and prizes to compete for the David Whyte scholarship. This is a scholarship of ten thousand dollars a year. What are your marks like? I have a ninety two percent average from my school, but I have not yet received the marks from my government exams? Well, if you get ninety five percent or better on your government exams, you could definitely be considered as a candidate for the David Whyte scholarship. The government exam is weighted fifty percent and your local school marks are weighted fifty percent. Most students in the past who have received this award had an average of over ninety three percent for their combined score. Um. If I don't get ninety five percent, would you say there was no use applying? Well, it certainly wouldn't be likely that you would be awarded this scholarship, but there is nothing preventing you from applying. There are generally about four hundred applicants a year. Does the David Whyte award guarantee me housing in the university residence? Yes, it guarantees housing and residence for all four years, provided you maintain the requisite three point oh grade point average. Another bonus if you have a car is parking privileges at the residence. If I'm not in the top two percent of entering freshmen, what other scholarships can I apply for? You could go to our website the faculty committee select students after a rigorous review of each student. Different awards have different criteria. Some scholarships and awards require you to write an essay, while others look at extra curricular activities, life hardships, distinctive personal achievements, or letters of recommendation. It varies widely. How many scholarships are there in all to apply for? There are well over one hundred. However, filling out scholarship applications is as time consuming job. So I would recommend you narrow down the ones you want to apply for do most scholarships applied to all four years? No. Most are on a yearly basis. The ones that are for the full four years providing that you maintain your eligibility through the required g p a in all quarters also usually give the additional privilege of preferential pre enrollment. This has the advantage of giving you first crack at registering in the course of your choice. Are all scholarships determined by the same committee? All full scholarships are, by the way, do you have a website address? Yes, I have it here on your card. I picked up your card when I was at the open house in the spring. Good. Well, then I would suggest you go to the website. Now. If you have further questions, you could give me a call back. Okay, thanks for your help. You are welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, D###Transcript:\n\nListen to part of a talk in an introductory art class. The professor is talking about choosing a career in the arts. Before you undertake a career in the arts. There are a number of factors to consider whether your goal is to be an actor or an animator, a saxophone, a store, a sculptor. Talent is an essential consideration, but talent alone won't guarantee a successful career in the arts. You also need training experience and self discipline. Most importantly, however, you should realize that a career in the arts requires a personal sense of commitment, a calling, because art does have a history of insecure employment. A lot of artists find it difficult, even impossible to live on the money they make from their art. Most have to supplement their income by teaching or by working behind the scenes or by doing other work not related to the arts. In your opinion, what's the best way for us to know if we really have a calling to art? Well, those of you who are interested in art as a career should talk with arts professionals or work in the arts yourselves. Professionals can give good first hand advice, but experience is the best way to get a feel for the field. What kind of experience, I mean, how do we get started? Experience doesn't have to be formal. It can be part time or volunteer work. For example, if you want to be a photographer or graphic designer, you could work for your school newspaper. Or if your interest is acting, you could start out in community theater. The important thing is getting started spending time doing something in your chosen medium.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, C, D###Transcript:\n\nSpeaker 1: ... yes, it's funny you should mention Merwin - until about a year ago I thought England was the only country that had a Poet Laureate. After all, it's a pretty odd job, isn't it? No salary to speak of and just a barrel of wine or something as payment. But he was or is the American Poet Laureate, isn't he?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's right, but quite a few other countries have one too.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know, I looked into it a bit. Other countries in the UK for a start: Wales, as you'd expect, with their eisteddfods and long poetic tradition , and Ireland and Scotland. I think some places that were colonies or are in the Commonwealth have them - Canada, for example. And who's that wonderful Caribbean poet, urn, the one that wrote Omeros?\n\nSpeaker 2: Derek Walcott.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's him. He was the Poet Laureate of Saint Lucia. But what about the rest of Europe? Don 't the French have such a thing?\n\nSpeaker 2: No, I don't think so. They've got the Academy, and you get elected to that if you're considered the best in your field. But I think Germany might have - no, it wasn't Germany. Somewhere else, but I don't remember. By the way, you're a bit behind the times in thinking what they get paid is a barrel of wine. All that changed long ago, but one of the more recent ones asked to have it back.###",

    "question": "###According to the speaker, which of the following measures helped reduce community problems in Brickendon?###A) allowing residents to patrol the area###B) interviewing residents about the problems###C) organizing regular community meetings###D) giving families financial support###E) identifying hotspots for crime###F) removing litter from the streets",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB, F###Transcript:\n\nIn places where there've been serious community tensions - I mean Brickendon's a good example of this. There were 250 reported incidents there in 2009...often to do with neighbours and arguments, but criminal activity too, um and the police will tell you that if you leave residents to sort things out for themselves the number of incidents rises - it doesn't fall. So the local council realized that they had to do something, so they went round to people's houses and met them and their neighbours and talked to everyone and got a general idea of what the local concerns were. If there were extended families involved. they looked at those particular families more closely and all the relatives and got some of the family intervention services to talk to them. And there were some very positive results. I mean, you can pick out the hotspots - you know. the main areas for crime but the hotspots don't tell you what causes the crime in the first place and so don't address the issues. So this proactive, more direct approach by the council worked well. And this was followed up with other quite practical solutions like cleaning up the area, getting rid of debris in alleyways and just making the place somewhere more agreeable - more liveable.###",

    "question": "###Which of the countries listed below continue to enforce punishments for failure to vote?###A) France###B) Bolivia###C) the UK###D) Australia###E) Austria###F) Greece",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, B, C, D, E###Transcript:\n\nPolitical parties in most democracies not only have to win more votes than their rivals to get into power, they also have to persuade the electorate that it is worth their going out to vote in the first place. In the UK, turnout is frequently low, and one reason cited is ... the weather! Some countries, therefore, have made voting compulsory; it is against the law not to vote and failing to vote is a punishable offense.\n\nIn Austria, for example, failure to vote results in an automatic fine, as it does in Australia. As a consequence, voter turnout is rarely less than 92% in both these countries. Other countries have penalties that affect the individual in more practical ways. In Greece, for example, although it is no longer acted on, passports were confiscated or not granted; and in Bolivia, non-voters may be banned from using banks or schools for up to three months. The punishment in countries, such as France, Germany, the UK, and so on, is seeing the government you didn't elect raise your taxes.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, D###Transcript:\n\nYes, the instructor is talking about pigments, whether you're working with oil, tempera, or water color, it's the pigment that gives the paint its color. A pigment can either be mixed with another material or applied over its surface in a thin layer when a pigment is mixed or ground in a liquid vehicle to form paint, it does not dissolve, but remain suspended in the liquid. A paint pigment should be a smooth, finely divided powder. It should withstand the action of sunlight without changing color. A pigment should not exert a harmful chemical reaction upon the medium or upon other color pigments. It is mixed with. Generally, pigments are classified according to their origin, either natural or synthetic. Natural. Inorganic pigments, also known as mineral pigments, include the native earth's, such as ochre, yellow, iron oxide, and raw umber, brown iron oxide. Natural organic pigments come from vegetable and animal sources. Some examples are indigo from the indigo plant, anterior perforated the imperial purple, the romans prepared from a shell fish native to the mediterranean. Today, many pigments are synthetic varieties of traditional inorganic and organic pigments. Synthetic organic pigments provide colors of unmatched intensity and tinting strength. The synthetic counterparts of yellow and red earths are more brilliant, and if well prepared, are superior in all other respects to the native products in organic synthetic colours made with the aid of strong heat are generally the most permanent for all uses. In contrast, pigments from natural sources are less permanent than the average synthetic color.###",

    "question": "###For what reasons do individuals take out bank loans?###A) To build a housing complex###B) To do medical research###C) To pay for education###D) To purchase a home",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, D###Transcript:\n\nOne very important institution in our economy is the bank. Banks manage money for individual people, corporations and the government banks provide a number of important services for you and your family. Most importantly, there a safe place to store your money. They also provide an easy way for you to transfer money from one place to another. When you write a personal check, the check authorizes the bank to give your money to the person or business whose name is on the check. Of course, banks also lend money. Ordinary people take out bank loans for a number of reasons, to pay for college, to buy or remodel a home, to start or expand a business, and so forth. Banks provide these services to individuals. However, their main function is to lend large sums of money, for example, to corporations. When people or corporations borrow money from a bank, they must, of course, pay interest a percentage of the money they borrowed. Banks pay interest on the money they hold and charge interest on the money they lend. For a bank to make a profit, it has to collect more interest than it pays out. Sometimes banks invest money as well as lend it. To invest money means to put it into a corporation or some other project, for example, building a housing complex or doing medical research in exchange for a share of the profits. Most businesses need loans and investments at some time, and banks are an important source of both. You might wonder what would happen if all the people with money in a bank wanted to take their money out at the same time. I mean, how would the bank be able to give everyone their money if it had lent out or invested most of it? In fact, this can be a serious problem for banks. They count on the fact that most people won't want their money for a long time. Once it's deposited, that leaves the bank free to lend or invest the money. If every person, or even lots of people tried to withdraw their money at the same time, the bank might not be able to honor all of its deposits. This causes some banks to fail or go bankrupt. Bank failures used to be common during times of recession or depression. They were especially common during the great depression of the nineteen thirties. When franklin roosevelt became president in nineteen thirty three, one of the first things he did was closed all the banks, so depositors wouldn't panic and try to take all their money out.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, E###Transcript:\n\nEven when we may not be aware of it, hearing music can affect our bodies as well as our minds. But are the physiological effects of music unique to one culture or are they more general?\n\nTo find out, researchers enlisted 40 Canadians from downtown Montreal and 40 Pygmies from the Congo rainforest. All the volunteers listened to musical clips from the movies Psycho, Star Wars and Schindler's List, and to music from Pygmy culture. As the participants listened, the researchers observed their emotional reactions, as well as psychophysiological responses like changes in heart rate, breathing rate and palm-sweat production. The two groups disagreed about whether a particular musical selection was happy or sad. But they all had similar levels of arousal, as measured by their psychophysiological responses. These findings suggest that some aspects of how we react to music are universal, rather than strictly cultural. The study is in the journal Frontiers in Psychology.###",

    "question": "###Which of the following are mentioned as mental health issues caused by poor sleep?###A) Alzheimer’s disease###B) cardiovascular risks###C) risky decision-making###D) being hyper-sensitive###E) lack of empathy###F) stroke and diabetes",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC, E###Transcript:\n\nWhat if you could make your sleep more efficient? As a sleep scientist, this is the question that has captivated me for the past 10 years. Because while the light bulb and technology have brought about a world of 24-hour work and productivity, it has come at the cost of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm and our body's need for sleep. The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day, and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm, which is putting our sleep health and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy. Because of this, we aren't getting the sleep we need, with the average American sleeping a whole hour less than they did in the 1940s. For some reason, we decided to wear it as a badge of honor that we can get by on not enough sleep. This all adds up to a real health crisis. Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes. And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, you're more likely to get many of these illnesses. But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states? Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions and is a drain on our capacity for empathy. When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain, it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others and just generally being a good and healthy person when we're sleep-deprived.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA, C, D###Transcript:\n\nResearchers report that women find a man they see with an attractive woman more desirable than unattached men. That's according to a study in the journal Evolutionary Psychology. Researchers had two groups of female college students rate photos of men, all of whom had first been rated as being of average attractiveness. The first group of 148 women was shown pictures of those men with an attractive female. The subjects were told that the women in the photos were either a girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, cousin or adopted sister. And the subjects rated the men with the girlfriends as more desirable than the men shown with partners described as being exes or relatives.\n\nThe second study group of 97 students were shown average looking men with an attractive woman who was described as definitely a girlfriend. And again the women rated the men with the good-looking gals as more desirable than the single guys. Plus, the attached men were thought more likely to be more intelligent, trustworthy, humorous, wealthy and attentive.###",
