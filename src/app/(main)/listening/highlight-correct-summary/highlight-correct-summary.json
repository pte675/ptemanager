    "question": "Click on the paragraph that best relates to the recording.###A) The main point is to question whether the biographical facts of a writer's life are of any importance in evaluating his work. Hemingway is the example used here, and there does seem to be a direct connection between the events of his life and those in his books, but knowing this should not get in the way of a true critical judgement of the works.###B) The writer Ernest Hemingway had a particularly eventful and exciting life and a lot of his real-life experiences got into his books. The speaker thinks this is irrelevant and doesn't believe that having lived such a full life makes the books any better, but he regrets that people now would prefer to read the biographies of writers rather than the books they wrote.###C) It is difficult to tell whether the speaker approves of Hemingway's lifestyle or not. He was famously macho and spent a lot of time hunting wild animals, going to wars and getting into fights. All these things got into his books, and the speaker thinks that this is not necessarily a good thing as it means that too many people prefer to read about his life than read his books.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nErnest Hemingway was famously masculine. We can see this in the topics he wrote about: all those fights and bullfights, all those wars, all that hunting and fishing. All this, it is thought, was overdoing it and must point to some deep insecurity in the man. Perhaps he felt that the conventional image of a writer as a person who doesn't do a lot more than sitting at a desk, not visibly contributing much socially or economically to society as a whole was unmanly and carried a certain amount of guilt and shame with it?\n\nDuring the First World War, he was badly wounded, hospitalized, and fell in love with a nurse. He wrote a novel about a man who was badly wounded in the First World War, was hospitalised and who fell in love with a nurse. The Spanish Civil War and the Second World War followed as did books about his experiences in them. Now, how much can we draw on a writer's biography to explain h is work? It should, l believe, be irrelevant to the judgement you bring to the merits of the individual work.\n\nBiographies of writers can be fascinating, especially if they lived as hard and fast as Hemingway, but, unfortunately, these days many people prefer the biography to the actual work. It is odd that the very reason a person would want to read a biography of a writer - that the subject has achieved fame and distinction in his field - should be the excuse for not reading his works.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nThis winter has been rather cold. It almost feels like we're entering a new ice age. Now don't laugh. This statement isn't as crazy as it seems. Yes. Global warming is a uh, hot topic these days, but more and more scientists are considering the possibility of global cooling occurring soon. This would result in the average temperatures on earth dropping. It has happened in the past, and it will happen again in the future. Earth is warm now, but that's not always the case. In the past, large parts of the planet were covered in ice. We call these periods ice ages. Note the plural. There wasn't just one ice age. There have been several. During the recent past. We experienced the little ice age. It lasted almost five hundred years from around, um, say thirteen hundred to eighteen hundred. The ice pack in the arctic ocean grew larger and moved south. Glaciers in the european alps and on greenland grew bigger and advance southward temperatures dropped all over the northern hemisphere. Winters were longer, summers were shorter, and summer rains were heavier. There were numerous famines since the cold and rain frequently destroyed crops. Why did this ice age and others like it happen? One theory claims that earth's orbit caused them. Earth orbit changes slightly over time, so the northern hemisphere receives less sunlight on those occasions. This reduces temperatures. IT's possible that an orbITal change caused the major ice ages. In case you're curious. The last such ice age happened around twenty thousand years ago. How often does earth's orbit change? No one knows for sure. Scientists estimated changes between every twenty thousand to fifty thousand years. There's also a second possible reason for global cooling. This relates to decreased solar activity. The appearance or lack of sunspots can affect temperatures here on earth. During the little ice age, there were significantly fewer sunspots. For instance, in one thirty year period, astronomers spotted a few dozens on spots. Normally, they would have seen tens of thousands of them with less solar activity. Some believe temperatures on earth decreased, thereby resulting in colder weather.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nThe Mayans were a group of people who lived in central America. They developed an advanced civilization. It lasted for, um, excuse me, it lasted for many centuries. Its high point was between the years two hundred and nine hundred. The Mayans are famous for a number of things. They built many city states. These were like small countries. Naturally, the center of each was a city farm, surrounded these cities and supported them with food. Mayan cities also contained exceptional works of architecture. The ruins of some buildings can be seen today. There are both large palaces and stepped pyramids. The Mayans had a writing system and literature, but they didn't use paper. Odd know. Instead they wrote on stone, wood and tree bark. Lots of writing was done on the insides and outsides of their temples and palaces. They also formed books from tree bark. But sadly, few of these books have survived to the present day. What happened to them? Well, first, the heat and wet weather of the jungle destroyed many, but Spanish conquerors got most of them. They actively sought to destroy the Mayans, written records. Fortunately, other objects, including my and works of art, have survived. We can see some of this art on the stones of their temples and palaces. The Mayans were excellent pottery makers as well. They created figures of stone, clay, and wood, and they even made some objects out of metal. But there are few extant examples of any metal devices.###",

But they can also generate huge forces. And here you might think of the sportsperson throwing a discus or lifting a heavy weight. How is it possible for our hands to be so incredibly flexible? Well, it's all down to the extraordinary complexity of the bones, ligaments, nerves and muscles that lie beneath the skin of our hands. There are, for example, nine muscles alone controlling just one thumb. Some of these are anchored to bones within the hand, while others link to the arm.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nInside Japan’s corporations, the culture emphasizes the success of a company as a whole to be more important than any single individual, which might explain why one study found that 63% of Japanese felt guilty for taking paid leave. But perhaps more concerning is this: Long work hours don’t necessarily mean high productivity. In fact, Japan has the lowest productivity amongst the G7 nations. Earlier I mentioned the term karoshi: it means death by overwork. It’s legally recognized by the government and usually is marked by a heart attack, stroke or suicide due to stress. There’s hundreds of cases of karoshi reported annually, although some argue these cases are under-reported and that the real number could exceed that by up to 10 times. An employee of the advertising firm Dentsu jumped to her death in 2015. The cause was said to have been depression caused by overwork. The case generated widespread attention and renewed calls to change the long working hours and illegal unpaid overtime highly common in Japan. The firm was fined for violating labor standards because she was reportedly forced to work more than 100 hours of overtime per month. The company’s CEO even resigned over the controversy. After the death, Dentsu made some changes within the company. One of them? The lights in the office now turn off at 10pm every night in an effort to force employees to leave.###",

De Tocqueville sketched an enduring analysis of the relationship between high expectations and dissatisfaction between political equality and envy. He wrote, when all the prerogatives of birth and fortune have been abolished, when every profession is open to everyone, an ambitious man may think it is easy to launch himself on a great career, and feel that he has been called to no common destiny. But this is a delusion which experience quickly corrects. When inequality is the general rule in society the greatest inequalities attract no attention. But when everything is more or less level, the slightest variation is noticed. That is the reason for the strange melancholy often haunting inhabitants of democracies in the midst of abundance, and of that disgust with life sometimes gripping them even in calm and easy circumstances.###",

Now, local governments, such as cities and counties, typically pass zoning laws. They regulate how people use the land in certain parts of the city or country. Think about our cITy for a moment. IT's divided into various districts. Some are commercial while others are residential. This isn't accidental. IT's intentional. This city developed this way because of zoning laws.

Industrial zones are for factories and other manufacturers. Agricultural zones are for farms, and recreational zones are for parks, lakes, and sporting facilities. So why do we need the zones? Well, think of it like this. Would you like a factory located right next to your house? How about a huge farm next to the shopping mall downtown?

So, it is the senses that provoke memories that can take us back to our childhood.###B) Using the writer Proust as an example, the speaker tells us how long-term memory works before going on to talk about short-term memory. Distant memories are usually involuntary and are brought to mind by something that stimulates one of the senses. Short-term memory also requires sensory input, but it lasts only a fraction of a second.###C) What we experience is processed by the brain into memories in three stages. First, there is the sensory input, which is momentary. This is then stored in the short-term memory. If this experience is important or meaningful to us, we will reinforce the memory, possibly by repetition, and it will then be stored in the long-term memory.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nIn his great novel Remembrance of Things Past or In Search of Lost Time, Marcel Proust explored what are called \"involuntary memories\" - those that come to us quite suddenly without conscious effort, usually triggered by one of the senses. The fact that his book has two titles in English might suggest there is some doubt as to how our minds go about remembering things. In perhaps the most well- known such episode in the novel, the character Marcel is reminded of his childhood by the aroma produced when dunking a cake in a cup of tea. This is not far away from the belief that as we get older we can remember quite clearly incidents from years ago, but find it hard to remember what we did last week. Proust's insight into memory is certainly true of one way the mind works. But why and how do we remember what we do?\n\nExperts believe that we store memories in three ways. First, there is the sensory stage which is to do with perception and lasts only a fTaction of a second, taking in sight, sound, touch, and so on. These first perceptions and sensations are then stored in the short-term memory, which is the second stage. Finally, important information or information that has been reinforced by, for example, repetition, is then filtered into the long-term memory. Naturally, we tend to more easily absorb material on things we already know something about, as this has more meaning for us and can create a web of connections with related material that is already stored in the long-term memory.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nUrn ... how did I get into anthropology? Well, l'm not an anthropologist, not trained in it anyway - in fact I'm a marine biologist - and it's more that I'm interested in the Strandlopers, the \"beach walkers\", if you like, than in anthropology generally. In fact, it was through my early interest in all things to do with the sea that I first heard of them. As a kid my favorite pastime was getting down to the beach and mucking about in rock pools and collecting anything the sea tossed up, and, um, the Strandlopers lived off the sea and seashore gathering food such as mussels, oysters, crabs, and so on, just as I did. So when I heard of them I thought, right, this is my kind of thing and I felt a kind of, well, affinity for them.\n\nAt first people thought they were a myth; I suppose because there didn't seem to be much evidence for their existence, but now we do have archaeological evidence such as pottery, discarded shells, the bones of seals and large fish, and so on. And those shells, we believe, became their first tools, and in some cases were also used as money and jewellery. Of course, before they had the implements, the, um, tools to hunt and fish, everything had to be caught by hand, so they kept mostly to shallow water. Then they might have used a primitive form of fishing line, perhaps the tendril of a climbing plant or a strip of animal skin with a bone or small piece of wood that would stick in the fish's throat. Anyway, the more we search the more we discover - most recently, caves on the coast have been discovered with ancient drawings.\n\nl find it endlessly fascinating.###",

In this class, we're going to study the various elements and how they interact with one another. Sometimes they unite. When two or more elements unite, we call them compounds. Now, uh, the study of chemical compounds is divided into two main branches of chemistry, organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry. Organic chemistry is the study of compounds that contain the element carbon. This basically covers well, uh, it covers all living things. Carbon is an element all living organisms have in common. As for inorganic chemistry, it's the study of non carbon based compounds. There are five differences between organic and inorganic compounds. Listen carefully to these. First, there are more than ten million carbon compounds. That's ten times the number of inorganic compounds. Why are there so many carbon compounds? Hm. Mostly because carbon bonds easily with other elements. It can also form complex cruise. Got it? Ok. Second, ah, organic compounds melt and boil at lower temperatures than in organic compounds. Third, organic compounds don't dissolve in water as easily as an organic compounds. Fourth, organic compounds catch fire more easily than in organic compounds. However, in organic compounds conduct heat and electricity more easily. Finally, organic compound reactions take place, and slower rates then do inorganic compound reactions.###",

This depends on the environment because a species adopts the lifestyle most suitable for this. Among dolphins, forming groups makes it easier for them to find food, reproduce and gain knowledge. They are safer, too, because dolphins can communicate danger when there are threats around.###B) The speaker explains that whales, dolphins, and porpoises have evolved differently and face different threats. River dolphin numbers are declining, while ocean dolphins are doing well in spite of the threats they face. The reason for this is that ocean dolphins are better adapted for finding food and avoiding predators.###C) Dolphins have adopted group living as a response to living in close contact with other animals in the ocean, some of which kill dolphins for food. Living in social groups makes it easier to hunt for food and, in a dangerous environment, it makes sense in terms of safety to move about in large numbers.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nAll whales, dolphins, and porpoises are social animals, although the degree of sociability varies greatly from one species to another. Differences of behavior have not evolved by chance. Living in close proximity to other animals has certain costs and benefits, so we can expect the group size adopted by a species to be the most suitable for its environment and lifestyle. River dolphins, for example, have a fairly simple social system, forming small groups of just a few animals- rarely more than ten. On the other hand, many of the oceanic dolphins may roam the seas in groups of thousands. Also, there can be differences within species: for example, with sperm whales, females and juveniles form groups while adult males are solitary. Some of the reasons for living in groups include greater efficiency in searching for and catching food, benefits for mating, learning, defence, and sensory integration. Now, sensory integration is the means by which each animal contributes to the information gained by the group as a whole, and this plays an important part in defence and in the search for food. For example, if one animal discovers a shoal of fish or a hungry shark, it can immediately pass on this information to the others in the group so that all may benefit. A single animal or small group may remain unaware of the food or predator, and so miss a meal or suffer an attack.###",

It would also make transportation to and from jobs and shops cheaper and quicker.###C) Cities like Perth in Western Australia are experiencing a rapid growth in urban development. and the current trend is to expand into surrounding regions. Although some people think this is more cost effective than building within cities, others believe it 's having a harmful effect on the environment in these areas.###D) The housing shortage in Perth is being addressed by encouraging people to move to other cities in Western Australia where there is more space to develop new housing and infrastructure. This will benefit people struggling to find accommodation and also avoid having to develop on bushland.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nUrban development is the first thing I wanted to talk about here in Perth. Urban development is going on at a great pace and the standard approach here in Western Australia is for suburban development to happen at the outer edges of the city. You have suburbs slowly spreading out into areas that are cleared. and this is eating into both areas of native bushland and land that used to be used for farming, for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe debate here is that on one side there's the idea that we need more housing. We have a housing shortage in Western Australia, and suburban expansion is essential. Suburban expansion on the edges of the city is cheaper and easier to do than building more homes within the city even though it's recognized it creates lots of problems with infrastructure and so on. On the other side of the debate, people say that urban sprawl is destroying bush and consequently the natural wildlife that exists there, and that it's too easy for developers to ignore these facts.###",

    "question": "Click on the paragraph that best relates to the recording.###A) There are three main interpretations of the English Revolution. The longest lasting interpretation was that the Revolution was the almost inevitable outcome of an age-old power struggle between parliament and crown. The second sees il as a class struggle, and a lead-up to the French and other revolutions. Finally, the third interpretation sees the other two as too fixed, not allowing for unpredictability, and that the outcome could have gone either way.###B) The speaker reminisces about his views of the English Revolution when he was a student and how it seemed quite clear which side he was on - the aristocrats', not the puritans'. Later he realised there was more to it than that and there were several ways of interpreting the Revolution: as a struggle between the king and parliament, as a class war or as an unpredictable situation without clear sides.###C) The English Revolution has been interpreted in several ways by historians: as a fight between the aristocratic Cavaliers, who were open to life, and the serious Puritans; as a battle for power between parliament and the monarchy over the rights of Englishmen that had been going on for centuries; and as a class war similar to the French Revolution, of which it was a forerunner.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nI want to look now at the three main approaches historians have taken towards the English Revolution or Civil War. There is a fourth point of view, taken up by most schoolchildren when they first meet the subject, but it can hardly be called historical. On the one hand, schoolchildren tend to have a romantic image of the Cavaliers, who were supporters of the monarchy, as aristocratic, charming, flashily dressed, and up for a bit of fun. On the other hand, they tend to regard the Roundheads or Puritans, who were followers of Oliver Cromwell, as miserable, working-class, dressed in black, and insisting on a life without luxuries. It isn't difficult then to takes sides.\n\nThe first approach, which prevailed up until the middle of the 20th century, was that the Revolution was part of the age-old battle between parliament and the monarchy, with parliament representing the traditional rights of Englishmen against the attempt by the Royal Family to increase its power and dictate law. In reaction to this, the second approach saw it as a working-class revolution and an important stage in the development of capitalism. In other words, they saw it as a class war, and a forerunner of the French Revolution and those that came after. Historians who supported the third approach saw that things weren't as clear cut as the others thought. Instead of seeing the Revolution as the result of long-term trends in the country's history, and therefore almost unavoidable, they focused on the details of the period immediately leading up to its outbreak and allowed for its unpredictability. The two sides，also, weren't so clear cut, with some aristocrats supporting parliament and some members of the working class fighting on the side of the monarchy.###",

Two men were involved in most of the important translation work. The first was thomas young, an english man. In eighteen fourteen, he made the first major discovery. He realized that the three tax contained the same information. He found about eighty words in the demonic and hieroglyphic text that were similar to words in ancient greek.

We know that a combination of very cold temperatures and waves is necessary to make the pancakes form in the first place. After these waves make it form, there's an entire spectrum - so a wide collection of frequency waves that they would encounter, whether they be from wind shear or they'd be from you know that the ocean long slow waves. The easiest way to study it is to look at each individual range of frequencies one after another. Sort of gain a wider perspective on how the pancake ice interacts with waves.

We're conducting work in the Sea-Ice-Wind-Wave-lnteraction facility here at UniMeIb. It was designed by the head of our department Jason Monty. He had the foresight to use a modular design, which means there are individual sections that are stacked together, so since we're built to the space that we have in this lab right now. When we moved to Fishermans Bend we can extend our model and a few more sections to make it much longer. And that will enable us to have longer runtimes, have more developed waves as well as add some other possibilities of study.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nOkay, so we've discussed the mosquitoes appearance and life cycle. Now let's cover what mosquitoes are most famous for sucking blood. Mosquitoes suck blood from various animals. You see a a mosquito has a long feeder appendage in its mouth. The appendage penetrates an animal skin, then the mosquito sucks the animals'blood. Interestingly, only females suck blood. The blood they get enables them to reproduce. How so proteins in the blood they suck help them produce the eggs they lay, so they don't use the bloodiest food for food. Both female and male mosquitoes usually nectar from plants. Tragically, mosquitoes kill more people than any other creature on earth. Their bites don't kill though, but the diseases that mosquitoes carry do millions of people die every year from malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, and other diseases that mosquitoes carry. When mosquitoes bite people, they transmit whatever diseases they happen to be carrying. Each year, more than two million people die from mosquito carry diseases. That's a big number, huh? Unfortunately, controlling mosquitoes is difficult, since they breed and spread rapidly. They lay their eggs in stagnant water, like, um, in swamps. So draining these areas can control them. Insecticides, you know, insect killers can also eliminate them. D d t is one such insecticide. IT's highly effective, but it's banned in many countries.

Now when there were more varieties, more customers stopped to try than when there were only six. But only about three percent of them actually went ahead and selected a product to buy. This is where it's interesting - when there were just six varieties, fewer people stopped to try but what the researchers noticed, and what they didn't expect, was that thirty percent of them bought a jar of jam.\n\nWhat does this show?

Rather to the investigators' surprise, they found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic make up, indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.###",

    "question": "Click on the paragraph that best relates to the recording.###A) Company leaders have to be careful that they do not have one set of practices for those in the office and another for those who telecommute. Besides needing to be fair at all times, managers will find that a telecommuting arrangement will simply not work if workers feel isolated and excluded from the company culture.###B) Telecommuting has a lot of advantages but to make it work, company leaders need to plan in advance to ensure that they anticipate issues for example training, security and communication. They also need to ensure that they hire workers who are suited to working remotely and ensure equal access to resources and advancement.###C) When workers ask if they can work from home, companies should consider a telecommuting arrangement, as it has several advantages for businesses as well as workers. There is money to be saved on overheads and training but for telecommuting to function properly. only independent staff should be allowed to work in this way.###D) Managers should not rush into letting their employees telecommute. It may sound good because businesses can save money on things like office space, but if workers' needs and ambitions are not well catered for in the arrangement. the company culture will ultimately be damaged and they may even be sued.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nNow. one of the workplace models I want to look at today is telecommuting. Done properly, telecommuting makes good business sense and companies can make huge savings on their overheads.\n\nIt can also be a very effective lure to recruit quality employees, but companies need to plan ahead and create the right culture for it to work. It's not as simple as just giving everybody a laptop and sending them off to work from home. Management needs to look at training, security and communication issues before any kind of telecommuting agreement is entered into.\n\nNow, a key part of making it work is ensuring that every employee - and that's whether they're at home or in the office - has equal access to resources and, of course, promotions. The last thing you want is to create a kind of 'us vs. them' scenario. The arrangement breaks down quickly if people start feeling isolated, or limited in their chances of moving up the ladder if they aren't physically in the office.\n\nThere has to be foresight, right from the start, in the hiring process. It's vital to screen employees carefully to determine who will be able to prosper working away from the office. Some companies give personality tests to prospective workers - and they do them online or over the phone to see if they're comfortable with that type of set up.###",

At 90 decibels level, people have risk of hearing loss begin. Lots of everyday life can damage your hearing, for examples, long term exposure to rock bands and jet engines.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nLong term exposure to noise can lead to loss of hearing. The relative loudness of sounds is measured in decibels. Just to give you an idea of what this means. The sound of a whisper is thirty decibels, while a normal conversation is sixty decibels. The noise of vacuum cleaner makes is around eighty five decibels. The danger zone, the risk of injury begins it around ninety. Continual exposure to sounds above ninety decibels can damage your hearing loud noises, especially when they come at you every day. All this noise can damage the delicate hair cells in your inner ear. Lots of everyday noises are bad for us in the long run. For example, a car horn sounds at around one hundred decibels. A rock band at close range is one hundred and twenty five decibels. A jet engine at close range is one of the worst culprits at an ear busting one hundred and forty decibels. The first thing to go is your high frequency hearing, where you detect the consonant sounds in words. That's why a person with hearing loss can hear voices, but has trouble understanding what's being said.###",

The equinox happens in march and september. That's when the planet is tilted, so that it's neither pointed away from nor toward the sun. So, uh, why do or or as occur they are the result of reaction in the upper atmosphere. Solar winds hit the earth's magnetic field. This may excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere. After some time, the atoms become relaxed. As they relax. The electrons in these atoms give off energy. This energy appears in the form of light. The color of the light depends on whether it comes from oxygen or nitrogen. In addition, the height in the atmosphere helps determine the colors that the light forms also.

Nevertheless, there is still some disagreement among researchers around what early humans actually used the fire for.###C) There has been much discussion by anthropologists about when humans started to use fires.

Well, prehistoric ash and the remains of burnt bones are evidence that early humans used fire much longer ago than previously envisaged. 300,000 years earlier than believed, in fact. Scientists have found evidence of multiple fires, ash and bones deep inside a cave which means it is highly improbable the fires were started naturally. One question that still remains unanswered is why they were using fire. Some researchers are citing the burnt bones as proof that our ancestors cooked the meat, but it has also been suggested they ate the meat raw and then tossed the bones into the fire.###",

    "question": "Click on the paragraph that best relates to the recording.###A) Brainpower is a survival technique that helped our ancestors. They had to do a lot of exercise and this creates proteins called BDNFs, which help the brain to develop. This is how humans have survived for so long and been so much more successful than other species.###B) People who work or study in modern classrooms or offices don’t get much exercise. Nowadays many people do little except sit and lie down, which isn’t good for proteins in the brain. This contrasts with our ancestors, who walked around 12 miles each day in their struggle for survival.###C) Modern classrooms and offices don’t help people’s brains to work well. This is because they discourage exercise. Exercise boosts brainpower because during exercise the brain produces a protein that encourages brain development. Our ancestors did a lot more exercise than us and this helped them to survive.###D) Our brains produce a special protein when we exercise, which helps the brain to grow and develop. This chemical was important for our ancestors due to the unstable and fast-moving environment in which they lived. However, in our current environment, we get this protein in other ways.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nIf you designed an almost perfect anti brain learning environment, it would look something like a typical classroom. And if you were to design an almost perfect anti brain working environment, it looks something like a typical office cubicle. Why? Because tiny proteins called a b d and f s are actually created when you exercise. And these help the brain to develop. So exercise boosts brain power. The problem lies in the fact that we measure distance today in terms of the space between the refrigerator, the bathroom and the couch, says robert hutchins. Whenever I feel like exercise, I lie down until the feeling passes. Our ancestors, on the other hand, walked an average of twelve miles a day, and hence the brain developed as a survival organ that was designed to solve problems in an unstable environment, in almost constant motion. If our ancestors had lain around, well, let's just say that survival didn't favor the sedentary types. So what are we to do? If I were an employer, i'd want the workplace environment to encourage exercise to boost my employees brain power.###",

While TV commercials can cost millions of dollars to make and air, it is possible to advertise to specific groups of people on the Internet.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nFor years, tv advertisements and print advertisements dominated the advertising industry. Yes, tv commercials and newspaper and magazine ads were expensive, but for most advertisers, the money they spent was worth it. People were watching television and reading newspapers and magazines, but times are changing. Television is still the biggest segment for advertisers, but that won't last for much longer. Instead, the internet will overtake both tv and print marketing very soon. There are several reasons for this. First is the internet growing popularity. Today, the number of people who surf the internet is enormous. In the nineteen eighties, few people own personal computers. Nowadays, most households have at least one pc, and more people are using the world wide web. Every year. People are also getting their news from the internet that's making print newspapers and magazines less popular. People are even watching tv programs on the internet. So as you can see, there's a growing audience available to internet advertisers. Another important reason is cost making an airing. A television commercial can cost a huge amount of money for local tv, it might be thousands of dollars, but for national tv, it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In some cases, advertisers spend millions of dollars to run thirty second commercials and highly rated tv shows or sports broadcasts, but it's much less expensive to advertise on the internet. Internet advertisements are typically cheap to make many times, they merely provide a link to a company's website. And they don't cost that much either. Some internet advertisements cost a few hundred dollars or even less to place on another website. The most expensive ads rarely require more than several thousand dollars. Finally, companies can advertise to specific groups on the internet. All sorts of people watch tv or read newspapers and magazines. So an advertisement for uh, baby products might not appeal to most of the audience or readers. However, a company advertising baby products on the internet can buy ad space on websites that parents with babies often visit. This lets the advertisers get more value from its money.###",

This is the result of their nonviolent communication, during which both sides had clearly mentioned their requests.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nLet’s imagine a college student being late for class. New Jay, who’s her current teacher, learned about nonviolent communication and knows that it begins with a clear observation. During observation he tries noticing concrete facts: things that happen at that very moment. New Jay jots down that Ann arrived 20 minutes late and that his pulse is up, possibly a sign of stress. When focusing on his feelings, New Jay connects with his heart and can learn to understand various underlying emotions. This is important because what seems to be anger, might in fact be sadness. During this step it is essential to distinguish feelings from thoughts. After class, New Jay shares his observation and explains to Ann that he feels disrespected when someone is late for his class. Knowing his needs is important because it allows him to enrich his life, and feel at peace. If we disregard our needs or don’t live up to our values, we experience stress and frustration.\n\nNew Jay tells Ann that they should find a way to respect each other’s values and desires. Lastly there is the request which clarifies what future New Jay wants for himself and this relationship. Clear requests are hence crucial to a transformative communication. When we ask for concrete actions, we often find creative ways to ensure that everyone’s needs are met. New Jay asks Ann not to come to class at all, if she happens to run later more than 1 minute.###",

On the other hand, the other 20% of Americans were either uninsured or faced the prospect of buying insurance in the unstable and discriminatory non-group insurance market. This is a market where it was totally legal for insurers to discriminate against the sick for any reason. Insurers could deny the sick coverage; they could charge them much more than the healthy for insurance or they could exclude their pre-existing illnesses from coverage. As a result, if you were healthy, you could get health insurance. This defeats the whole notion of health insurance.

The first and most common is the phonics method. Here's how teachers use phonics first. They teach their students the alphabet. So the students learn the letters and which sounds each one makes. The instructors also teach the students how letters can blend together. Then they often show the students sentences with similar sounds. For example, um, the cat sat on the hat. How now? Brown cow? Or how about this one? There's a mouse in the house. You remember those, right? Well, as students learn more sounds, they learn more words. This helps them improve their vocabulary level. Soon. Students who use the phonics method are able to read new words and sound them out for themselves. I think you can see why this method is so successful. That's the first method. But like I said, there are three more ways. The next is the look and say method. This basically teaches children to recognize words and remember how to say them. This involves a lot of memorization.

Their teeth were flat and designed for grinding tough material such as plants, though they were sometimes ground down to a flat surface. This led to problems with dentition. Allosaurs, on the other hand, like tigers, had sharp teeth for eating meat.###D) Researchers have found that dinosaurs had the same kinds of diet-related issues with their dentition as modern-day animals. Meat-eaters in particular had tooth cavities due to bacteria in their food. However, herbivores also had problems due to their teeth being ground down as they chewed on tough plant fibres.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nTo understand what extinct animals such as dinosaurs eight, we can compare their tooth types to the range of tooth types that we see with modern animals, such as carnivorous and herbivorous animals. So when we look at a tiger skull, we can look at aspects of its dentition or its teeth to understand what it ate. So when we see pointed and sharp teeth, we can see that they are very well adapted for slicing, shearing, and cutting flesh. Unlike the tiger, when we look at a herbivorous animal, a horse, we can see that it's teeth are arranged in a nice, flat, grinding surface. And so when the top and lower teeth fit together, they actually grind up plant material. When we look at fossils like this one, which belongs to an alice, or we can see teeth that are conical and re curve backwards with sharp points answer eighty dead jizz. But these kinds of clues tell us that this animal was a meat eating animal. Now we'll look at the jaw of a hadrosaur on one side. You can see many of its teeth. When we turn it around, you can see a long, flat, grinding surface. By comparison, we can infer that this animal was also a plant eater, just like the horse that showed us a very similar kind of dentition. This animal also ate plants and other tough fibrous material.###",

The environmental changes can make it harder for us to make a purchase, and thus help us to save money.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nD###Transcript:\n\nWe’ve run a few different studies and found that the number one purchase people say they regret, after bank fees, is eating out. It’s a frequent purchase we make almost everyday, and it’s death by a thousand cuts. A coffee here, a burrito there. It adds up and decreases our ability to save. Back when I lived in New York City, I looked at my expenses and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars on ride-sharing apps. It was more than my New York City rent. I vowed to make a change. And the next month, I spent 2,000 dollars again — no change, because the information alone didn’t change my behavior. I didn’t change my environment. So now that I was 4,000 dollars in the hole, I did two things. The first is that I unlinked my credit card from my car-sharing apps. Instead, I linked a debit card that only had 300 dollars a month. If I needed more, I had to go through the whole process of adding a new card, and we know that every click, every barrier, changes our behavior. We aren’t machines. We don’t carry around an abacus every day, adding up what we’re spending, in comparison to what we wanted. But what our brains are very good at is counting up the number of times we've done something. So I gave myself a limit. I can only use ride-sharing apps three times a week. It forced me to ration my travels. I got a handle on my car-sharing expenses to the benefit of my husband, because of the environmental changes that I did. So get a handle on whatever that purchase is for you, and change your environment to make it harder to do so.###",

The example of what it must have been like to be a peasant in the Middle Ages is used. However, sensibilities change over time and we can't completely throw off the mentality of the present. Therefore, every age will have a slightly different perspective on the same period of the past, no matter what the facts are.###B) The text explains how, in order to understand people in the historical period they are studying, a historian must have the same ability the novelist has to get into the minds of characters. This is due to the fact that the world was different then, and the ways of thinking have changed, for example, between the Middle Ages and the 21st century. He explains this by saying historian's sensibilities change over time.###C) As a historian, if you really want to understand the sensibilities of those who lived in the past, you must be like a novelist and get into the skins of your characters and think and feel as they do. You are asked to imagine what it's like to be a peasant in medieval times, asking the sort of questions a peasant might ask. What the writer is saying is that a historian needs imaginative sympathy with ordinary people in the past.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nTo reach some kind of understanding of a period in the past - the Middle Ages, say- requires a creative act of the imagination not unlike that of a novelist getting inside the skins of their characters or establishing the environment they live in. What must it have been like to be a peasant under a feudal baron? What might his beliefs and politics have been? Did he, for example, think his situation was simply part of the natural order of things, or that it was grossly unfair and needed to be overthrown?\n\nSo, you have to imagine the terms under which life was lived in those days, and learn to feel in a different way about things by putting yourself into a world very different from your own. Now, of course, every age views the past from its own present and an 18th century historian's concept of the Middle Ages will be very different from that of one from the 21st century- which is why each age has to write its history over again. It's not so much that more facts or evidence come to light- if they do- but that sensibilities change too.###",

Let me tell you it's the ability of a material to resist being damaged, scratched, or marred in any way. There's even a way to measure it. It's the most scale of hardness. A german scientist, um, a mineralogist named fredrick, most came up with the scale in eighteen twelve. Here's how we made it. Most took ten different minerals, then he rated them from one to ten based on their ability to withstand damage and to damage other materials. Tell received a rating of one. It's soft, it's easily scratched, can hardly damage anything. Diamond received a rating of ten. It's the hardest natural substance known to man. The other objects on this scale, that number from two to nine are gypsum, calcite, fluoride, appetite, feldspar, quartz, topaz, and corundum. I see worried looks on your faces. Don't worry about writing them down there. Listed on page two hundred and thirty four of your text. Take a look. Now, what about the hardness of other objects? Hm. It depends on which of the ten minerals can scratch them. For instance, your fingernails get a rating of two point five on the most scale. So tell can gypsum can't scratch them, but calcite can. Well, what are some others? Let's see, iron is rated between four and five glasses between six and seven, and steel is close to eight.###",

Now, of course, it works both ways: if you were, say, eighteen years old when mobile phones became widespread or when almost every home had a computer, you must have noticed a fairly significant change in people's attitudes and behavior, including your own. These two technological innovations were readily accepted and considered very much a positive contribution to culture.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the way in which our attitudes and beliefs have an effect on the material culture. Take, for example, genetic science. While many, if not most, people welcome the advances made in this field - from the discovery of DNA to the genome project and cracking the genetic code, with its promise of finding cures for diseases that have plagued mankind throughout history - many, too, object to the idea of cloning. This is not just because they fear, without reason, that it will mean creating a race of identical people if it gets into the wrong hands, but simply because it is, in their opinion, unnatural. It goes against everything they believe in. Similarly, there are many who object to genetically modified food, even when they are told it might be the only way to feed a rapidly growing global population.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nA hurricane is a massive storm system. In fact, It's the most powerful type of storm on earth. Hurricanes form over warm tropical waters and frequently move toward land. Ah. Before I forget to mention this, hurricanes are also called typhoons or cyclones. It depends on where exactly they form. Not all hurricanes are alike. Some are well, more powerful than others. Meteorologists have a rating system for them. They used the term category to rank. Every hurricane that forms the scale ranks hurricanes according to their wind speed and ability to cause damage. A category one hurricane is the weakest. A category five hurricane is the most powerful. A hurricane typically begins as a tropical storm. It has wind speeds between fifty to one hundred kilometers per hour. When the wind blows faster than one hundred kilometers per hour, the tropical storm has become a hurricane, a category one hurricanes winds are between one hundred to one hundred and thirty kilometers per hour. A category two hurricane has winds up to one hundred sixty kilometers per hour. Winds between one hundred sixty and one hundred eighty five kilometers per hour indicate a category three hurricane. A category four hurricane has winds speeds up to two hundred twenty kilometers per hour. Anything above that is a class five her. Again, thankfully, those are quite rare. They are simply devastating when they form and make landfall. Oh, by the way, before you ask typhoons and cyclones use different measuring systems.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nMost societies throughout history employed some strategies to help people in poverty meet basic needs. Before the 20th century, religious groups and private charities often led such initiatives. Today, these are called welfare programs, and they usually take the form of government-provided subsidies for housing, food, energy, and healthcare. Typically, these programs are means-tested, meaning that only people who fall below a certain income level are eligible for benefits. This policy is designed to ensure aid goes to those who need it most. But it also means people lose access as soon as they earn more than the qualification threshold, regardless of whether or not they’re financially stable enough to stay there. This vicious cycle is harmful to both those in poverty and those outside of it. Mainstream economic models assume people are rational actors who weigh the cost and benefits of their options and choose the most advantageous path forward. If those in poverty know they’ll gain no net benefit from working, they’re incentivized to remain in government assistance. Of course, people work for many reasons, including societal norms and personal values. But income is a major incentive to pursuing employment. And when less people take on new jobs, the economy slows down, keeping people in poverty and potentially pushing people on the cusp of poverty over the edge.###",

They enter living things and caused them to get sick and sometimes to die. But living things have defenses against pathogens. These defenses are found in their immune systems. There are two types of immune systems, innate and adaptive. First, let's examine the innate immune system. An innate immune system in a living thing is always active.

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nOne of the great contributing factors to mental illness is the idea that we should at all costs and at all times be well. We suffer far more than we should because of how long it can take many of us until we allow ourselves to fall properly and usefully ill. In a crisis, our chances of getting better rely to a significant extent on having the right relationship to our illness: an attitude which is relatively unfrightened by our distress, which isn’t overly in love with the idea of seeming at all times ‘normal’, which can allow us to be deranged for a while in order one day to reach a more authentic kind of sanity. It will help us immensely in this quest if the images of mental illness we can draw on at this time do not narrowly imply that our ailment is merely a freakish and pitiable possibility, if we can appeal to images that tease out the universal and dignified themes of our state, so that we do not – on top of everything else – have to fear and hate ourselves for being unwell.###",

I live in the part of western London where I think many of the streets are really really ugly, and this distresses me everytime when I walk to a supermarket or walk to the tube. I do not understand why they built those buildings without architecture. A bad building has a serious impact on the people around it, which could be hundreds of years. It lasted so long, and if you write a bad book or a bad play, I will be shocked when it was shown. Suppose the book arose a little bit from the frustration, and then I realize if you talk about architecture, you will say why building are not more beautiful. Then you will say I can use such work as \"beauty\", which is a really arrogant word. And no one knows what beautiful is. It's all in the eye of the beholder. I couldn't help but think about that actually. Well, you know that we all attempt to agree that Rome is nice than Milkykings, and San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt, so we can make that sort of generalization.

One of my favorite quotes from Maya Angelou I think can apply to friendships. “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” So when you're building friendships with people, they're going to show you initially who they are. So trust that. And I'm a big proponent of trusting your instincts and investing in friendships that make you feel comfortable from the outset.###",

    "question": "Click on the paragraph that best relates to the recording.###A) The speaker tells us that cliches are the enemy of literature and art. They are words, phrases and images that have become stale through overuse and therefore have nothing new to say to us. They are an enemy to clear and original thinking, although they are sometimes useful in advertising to get a simple message across.###B) While cliches in writing reveal lazy thinking and are to be avoided at all costs, in the graphic arts they become essential, helping to get the message across quickly, clearly and with emotional force. This is especially true of advertising and propaganda where the impact must be immediate.###C) Cliches are worn out, overused and over-familiar phrases, and the etymology of the word helps to explain this. Originally, a cliche or stereotype was a printer's term for a pre-set block of type with phrases used frequently in the newspapers. The word has since adopted a negative meaning and careful writers avoid them where they can.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nB###Transcript:\n\nA cliche, as you know, is an overused and worn out phrase - and ... um ... these are to be avoided like the plague in your essays. Indeed, someone once said, I quote, \"there is no greater danger to either education or thinking than the popular phrase\". Let me digress a little further; originally a cliche was a printer's term, back in the days when letters were set one by one, for a ready-made block of type of frequently used phrases, usually in the newspaper business. So ... there you are ... urn ... cliches were also known as stereotypes.\n\nNow, if you think of graphic design as a language with its own vocabulary, grammar, and so on, it too must have its cliches. Obvious examples would be, urn, the twin Greek masks of comedy and tragedy that symbolize the theater and, more popularly known, the heart as a symbol of love, especially on Valentine cards, and so on. Far from being a terrible fault - as it would be in literature - the visual cliche is essential in the world of graphic communication. This is certainly true when it comes to advertising and propaganda. The visual cliche can give immediate life to an idea and a clear meaning to what could be a mere abstraction.###",

Another reason is that it hasn’t reached the height limit of 15km yet.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nBased on the strength of Earth's gravity and the density and strength of rock, in principle you could make a single conical mountain that stretched between New York and Chicago and soared over 45km! That's twice the size of Olympus Mons and definitely dwarfs Everest. However, there are a couple of reasons why we can't actually have that humongous of a mountain on Earth. For one, Earth's crust is made up of continental plates that essentially float in the semi-solid rock of the mantle below. If you add more weight above the surface, they sink lower into the earth's hot interior, and when they sink far enough, they soften and basically melt. For our conical mountain, that gives a new height limit of just 15km. As well, the powerful collision of two tectonic plates, which creates mountains in the first place, also fractures and cracks the rock, weakening its structure and exposing it to erosion. Over millions of years, freeze-thaw cycles pry at these cracks, while winds claw at the slopes and streams and glaciers carve deep valleys into the mountainside, all weakening the mountain's support. This can end badly. For example, 3,764m tall Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand had its top fall off one night in 1991, trimming it down to a 3,754m mountain. Given all the factors that conspire to limit the height of mountains, for example sinking into the earth's mantle, fractures, and erosion, I wouldn't bet on our tallest mountains getting too much taller than they already are.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nA###Transcript:\n\nMalaria’s ability to resist drugs is one of the reasons success in eradicating it has leveled off. New ways to tackle malaria are being developed, seeking to wipe out the mosquitoes that carry the disease. A gene editing technology called CRISPR is being used to engineer a gene drive. This creates selfish genes that always passed onto offspring. The aim is to interfere the fertility by driving a gene for sterility through an entire population. As it is passed from generation to generation, the population would be swamped with insects that are unable to reproduce. In theory, they could be driven to extinction. Last year, a team at Imperial College London successfully created a gene drive that wiped out enclosed cohorts of one species of malaria-carrying mosquito. But there is no guarantee that gene drives could work in the many environments where malaria is found in the world, especially in Africa. Humanity had shown that it can control malaria. It has been eradicated in around 35 countries. Currently the best hope lies in the combination of methods. But in the future, a gene drive may be the most effective solution.###",

Many workers died either on the journey or from disease and overwork in the city build itself. The Tsar did not pay his workers or provide food and because of this, many more died.###B) Russian Tsar Peter I wanted a new capital city so that he could compete with other European capitals. He built the city on a river so that it would be easier to bring workers and materials into the city to help with the building process.###C) There were three challenges with the construction of St Petersburg: the unsuitability of the wet land in the location he chose, the difficulty of transporting builders to the remote location, and the poor conditions they were working in and the lack of raw materials for the construction process.###D) St Petersburg was the first city to be built on water and this is why the construction process was so challenging. It was such a big project requiring so many men and materials that building in other parts of Russia stopped while the city was being built.###",
    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nFew cities had a worse location than st. Petersburg in russia. In seventeen o three, russian tsar peter the first began building a great european city for himself, st. Petersburg. There were three main problems with the city. Firstly, he decided to construct his beautiful capital at the mouth of a river. The land around the site was under water most of the time and was either frozen or flooded. Over a hundred thousand construction workers died working in such difficult conditions. The second problem was the availability of construction workers. Few people lived in that area. And the high death rate meant that peter needed to bring in a constant supply of replacement workers from other parts of russia using the military service system. He ordered forty thousand men each year to go and work on his capital. The men were expected to provide their own tools and food for the journey, often with soldiers watching over them, and they were chained together to prevent them from running away. Illness was everywhere, and punishments went from whipping to death. The final problem was supplying the materials themselves. Whole forests were cleared to provide wood hills flattened and leagues filled in. Stone became so hard to find that peter band, anyone else in russia from using it? It was a truly impossible city to build and made him unpopular.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nGenealogy can be defined as the compilation of information necessary to construct what is usually known as a family tree, our pedigree or our ancestry. It is a chart which shows the relationships between individual people in an extended family over a period of time.\n\nThe first records of genealogy can be traced back to the earliest civilisations in Northern Africa who recorded successions of dynasties and wealthy families reaching back hundreds of years. This was usually done to establish rights to title, land and property. There is evidence that this happened in many places in the world. However, it was the domain of the wealthy and few people outside those circles were even aware that family ancestry could be recorded and traced. This situation changed in the early nineteenth century when genealogy became more generally well-known after the first practical guide to research was published. But it was not until the mid twentieth century that family history was no longer solely devoted to tracing the genealogies of the great. the wealthy, or the famous and it became a more common activity among the general population.###",

    "answer": "Answer:\n\nC###Transcript:\n\nAs populations have aged, dementia has soared to become the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease, a form of dementia, accounts for most of these cases. Tens of billions of dollars have been spent on Alzheimer’s research over the past several decades, but still there is no cure. All attempts to halt the progression of the disease have failed. Now many major drug companies have pulled out of research altogether. So why is Alzheimer’s disease still such a medical mystery? One of the signs of Alzheimer’s in the brain is damage of connections and the loss of large numbers of neurons over time. It affects the hippocampus and its connected structures, making it harder to form new memories or learn new information. As damage spreads through the brain, the cortex becomes thinner and more memories are lost, although emotional responses can often remain. As the brain shrinks further, it slowly alters personality and behavior and eventually the ability to live and function independently.###",
