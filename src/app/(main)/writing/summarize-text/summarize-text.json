    "content": "The product life cycle has 4 very clearly defined stages, each with its own characteristics that mean different things for business that are trying to manage the life cycle of their particular products.\n\nIntroduction Stage – This stage of the cycle could be the most expensive for a company launching a new product. The size of the market for the product is small, which means sales are low, although they will be increasing. On the other hand, the cost of things like research and development, consumer testing, and the marketing needed to launch the product can be very high, especially if it’s a competitive sector.\n\nGrowth Stage – The growth stage is typically characterized by a strong growth in sales and profits, and because the company can start to benefit from economies of scale in production, the profit margins, as well as the overall amount of profit, will increase. This makes it possible for businesses to invest more money in the promotional activity to maximize the potential of this growth stage.\n\nMaturity Stage – During the maturity stage, the product is established and the aim for the manufacturer is now to maintain the market share they have built up. This is probably the most competitive time for most products and businesses need to invest wisely in any marketing they undertake. They also need to consider any product modifications or improvements to the production process which might give them a competitive advantage.\n\nDecline Stage – Eventually, the market for a product will start to shrink, and this is what’s known as the decline stage. This shrinkage could be due to the market becoming saturated (i.e. all the customers who will buy the product have already purchased it), or because the consumers are switching to a different type of product. While this decline may be inevitable, it may still be possible for companies to make some profit by switching to less-expensive production methods and cheaper markets. ",
    "answer": "The product life cycle has 4 clearly defined stages, sales are usually low during introduction stage and then start to increase during growth stage where the company can benefit from economies of scale in production, this is followed by maturity stage when the product is established and manufacturers aim to maintain their market share, the last stage is decline stage where the market for a product will start to shrink.  ",

In addition, the NOC also led an international study demonstrating deep-sea nodule mining will cause long-lasting damage to deep-sea life, lasting at least for decades.\n\nThese nodules are potato-sized rocks containing high levels of metals, including copper, manganese and nickel. They grow very slowly on the sea-bed, over millions of years. Although no commercial operations exist to extract these resources, many are planned.\n\nProfessor Edward Hill, Executive Director at the NOC commented, “By 2050 there will be nine billion people on earth and attention is increasingly turning to the ocean, particularly the deep ocean, for food, clean supplies of energy and strategic minerals. The NOC is undertaking research related to many aspects and perspectives involved in exploiting ocean resources. This research is aimed at informing with sound scientific evidence the decisions that will need to be taken in the future, as people increasingly turn to the oceans to address some of society’s greatest challenges.”",

    "content": "Some of this panic is overdone—and linked to the business cycle: there was much ado about “a war for talent” in America in the 1990s, until the dotcom bubble burst. People often talk about shortages when they should really be discussing price. Eventually, supply will rise to meet demand and the market will adjust. But, while you wait, your firm might go bust. For the evidence is that the talent shortage is likely to get worse.\n\nNobody really disputes the idea that the demand for talent-intensive skills is rising. The value of “intangible” assets—everything from skilled workers to patents to know-how—has ballooned from 20% of the value of companies in the S&P 500 to 70% today. The proportion of American workers doing jobs that call for complex skills has grown three times as fast as employment in general. As other economies move in the same direction, the global demand is rising quickly.\n\nAs for supply, the picture in much of the developed world is haunted by demography. By 2025 the number of people aged 15-64 is projected to fall by 7% in Germany, 9% in Italy and 14% in Japan. Even in still growing America, the imminent retirement of the baby-boomers means that companies will lose large numbers of experienced workers in a short space of time (by one count half the top people at America's 500 leading companies will go in the next five years). Meanwhile, two things are making it much harder for companies to adjust.\n\nThe first is the collapse of loyalty. Companies happily chopped out layers of managers during the 1990s; now people are likely to repay them by moving to the highest bidder. The second is the mismatch between what schools are producing and what companies need. In most Western countries schools are churning out too few scientists and engineers—and far too many people who lack the skills to work in a modern economy (that's why there are talent shortages at the top alongside structural unemployment for the low-skilled).",
    "answer": "The issue of talent shortage is likely to get worse because global demand for talent-intensive skills is rising in recent years, especially for developed countries, which is caused by three reasons including the retirement of the baby-boomers, the collapse of loyalty as well as the mismatch between what school teach and what companies need.",

Golden stucco-clad houses stretch for street after identical street, interspersed with gated communities with names such as Spanish Oaks and Rancho Bel Air. The sky is the deepest blue, the desert air is clear and the distant mountains are beautiful. The only sounds are the buzz of a gardener’s hedge trimmer and a squeaking baby buggy pushed by a power-walking mother. The bright lights of Sin City seem a very long way away.\n\nYet these quiet streets are being changed by a movement that is gathering momentum across America and around the world, challenging one of the most fundamental of economic relationships: the way we use and pay for energy. There are now more than 7,000 homes in Nevada fitted with solar panels to generate their own electricity, and the number is rising fast. Just five years ago, residential solar power was still a niche product for the homeowner with a fat wallet and a bleeding heart. Not anymore. Technology, politics and finance have aligned to move it into the mainstream. Solar power has become the fastest-growing energy source in the US.\n\nFor decades the electricity industry has been a cautious and conservative business, but the plunging prices of solar panels, down by about two-thirds in the past six years, have woken it up with a bang. Dynamic rooftop solar power companies have entered the market, in the most radical change to electricity supplies since the industry was born in the 19th century. It has been described as the equivalent of the mobile revolution in telephony, or the PC in computing.",

    "content": "Kids mimic what their parents do -- and a new study on TV-viewing habits proves just that. Research published July 15 in Pediatrics shows that the amount of time parents watch TV is connected to how much TV their children watch, even more so than the location of the TV in the home or the family's rules for television watching. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that children and teens should only be allowed to use \"high-quality\" entertainment media for one to two hours per day. In addition, the house should have \"screen-free\" zones like the children's bedroom, where there are no TVs, computer games or video games. The TV should be turned off during dinner, the academy adds.\n\nEach hour of TV viewed by the parents was linked to an additional half hour of viewing time for children. Children whose parents watched more than the average also watched more compared to kids whose parents stuck to the four hours daily.\n\nParents' TV time had a stronger association to how much time children watched television compared to house rules on time limits, whether the children had a TV in the bedroom and whether the family was watching together.\n\nParents who restricted television time only were able to cut down viewing times for children who were in the 6 to 11-year-old age group. Adolescents watched about one more hour of TV than their parents thought they did, the results also showed.",

The scientists tracked more than 23,000 adults, finding that the benefits of napping were most pronounced for working men.\n\nResearchers have long recognized that Mediterranean adults die of heart disease at a rate lower than Americans and Northern Europeans. Diets rich in olive oil and other heart-healthy foods have received some of the credit, but scientists have been intrigued by the potential role of napping.\n\nThe study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, concluded that napping was more likely than diet or physical activity to lower the incidence of heart attacks and other life-ending heart ailments.\n\nStill, the authors cautioned that further research is needed to confirm their findings.",

Most arable land is found in southern Sweden, but there are arable parcels up to the Arctic Circle. Wheat, barley, sugar beets, oilseeds, potatoes, and staple vegetables dominate in the south, while in the north hay and potatoes are the main crops. In Sweden as a whole, animal agriculture is more significant than cereal farming. Dairy cows are important in all parts of the country, while pig and poultry raising are concentrated in the extreme south. The yields of Swedish farms are among the highest in the world. Environmental problems, however, have made it necessary to reduce the use of fertilizers.\n\nAbout half of Swedish forestland is privately owned, about one-fourth company-owned, and about one-fourth publicly owned. Forest work used to be complementary winter employment for small farmers using their horses; today forestry is carried on year-round by a small workforce and large, modern machinery. Nearly three-fourths of all Swedish farms have timberland. The average regrowth and harvest time for spruce and pine is about 50 years in the south and roughly 140 years in the north. Since the late 19th century, forestry in Sweden has been conducted on a sustained-yield basis, which establishes a ratio between cutting and new growth that is strictly enforced. Modern large-scale forestry methods have been subject to severe criticism, and major reforms were implemented in the 1990s. A thorough mapping and inventory of key woodland habitats was undertaken in the mid-1990s to identify areas with high biodiversity values.",

In the case of seafood, sustainability relates to fish and shellfish caught for human consumption by fishers operating under sustainable fishery-management systems. According to Fish Watch, these systems conserve fish stock and the ecosystems that support these species.\n\nFish Watch offers a simpler definition, explaining that sustainable seafood refers to any seafood products that are healthy for the planet, people and economy. Sustainable seafood aims to offer healthy products without harming the oceanic environment and other species in a way that matters in the long run.\n\nThe quest to find sustainable seafood is an endurance race, not a quick sprint. It involves coordinating fisheries with government regulators and consumers. Consumers are empowered to make sustainable food choices when they have information and education on selecting the best products with the people, planet and economy in mind.\n\nSustainable seafood choices impact not just one spot on the bottom of the ocean but the entire oceanic environment. They can potentially have a lasting impact on fish populations and communities which heavily rely on fish farming and fishers for a sufficient protein source and millions of jobs. In 2015, the seafood industry alone accounted for 1.6 million jobs in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, the health of our oceans affects the quality of the food we receive. Factors like what chemicals companies are fishing with or what bacteria might they introduce into water sources can significantly impact human well-being on a global scale. If you like seafood and want to help support the supply of your favorite dockside dishes, choosing sustainable seafood can make a big impact over time.",

The techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which are used to elucidate such structures do not work on all proteins. Some types are hard to produce or purify in the volumes required. Others do not seem to crystallize at all—a prerequisite for probing them with X-rays. As a consequence, those structures that have been determined include representatives of less than a third of the 16,000 known protein families. Researchers can build reasonable computer models for around another third because the structures of these resemble ones already known. For the remainder, however, there is nothing to go on.\n\nIn addition to this lack of information about protein families, there is a lack of information about those from the species of most interest to researchers: Homo sapiens. Only a quarter of known protein structures are human. A majority of the rest come from bacteria. This paucity is a problem, for in proteins form and function are intimately related. A protein is a chain of smaller molecules, called amino acids, that is often hundreds or thousands of links long. By a process not well understood, this chain folds up, after it has been made, into a specific and complex three-dimensional shape. That shape determines what the protein does: acting as a channel, say, to admit a chemical into a cell; or as an enzyme to accelerate a chemical reaction; or as a receptor, to receive chemical signals and pass them on to a cell’s molecular machinery.",

The waves can ricochet from the front of the brain to the back, or from deep structures all the way to the scalp and then back again.\n\nCalled neuronal oscillations, these signals are known to accompany certain mental states. Quiet alpha waves ripple soothingly across the brains of meditating monks. Beta waves rise and fall during intense conversational turns. Fast gamma waves accompany sharp insights. Sluggish delta rhythms lull deep sleepers, while dreamers shift into slightly quicker theta rhythms.\n\nResearchers have long argued over whether these waves have purpose, and what those purposes might be. Some scientists see waves as inevitable but useless by-products of the signals that really matter — messages sent by individual nerve cells. Waves are simply a consequence of collective neural behavior, and nothing more, that view holds. But a growing body of evidence suggests just the opposite: Instead of by-products of important signals, brain waves are key to how the brain operates, routing information among far-flung brain regions that need to work together.\n\nMIT’s Earl Miller is among the neuro­scientists amassing evidence that waves are an essential part of how the brain operates. Brain oscillations deftly route information in a way that allows the brain to choose which signals in the world to pay attention to and which to ignore, his recent studies suggest.\n\nOther research supports this view, too. Studies on people with electrodes implanted in their brains suggest brain waves, and their interactions, help enable emotion, language, vision and more.",

However, a recent study published in the American Journal of Political Science by a University of Michigan political scientist finds that female activists differ little from their male counterparts, many of whom engage in policy issues of more general concern at the national level for rewards that are largely material.\n\n\"We expected to find gender differences among activists in terms of the activities in which they specialize, the gratifications they reap from taking part, and the issues that animate their participation,\" says Nancy Burns, U-M assistant professor of political science. \" Probe as we might, we were surprised to find much more similarity than difference between men and women on all these dimensions.\"\n\n\"Contrary to expectation, we find no statistically significant gender difference in how importantly issues involving basic human needs, children or youth, the environment, or crime or drugs figure in issue-based participation,\" the researchers say.\n\nThey add, however, that men are slightly more likely to mention taxes (15 percent of men vs. 12 percent of women) and foreign policy (8 percent of men vs. 5 percent of women) as compelling concerns for taking part in politics.\n\nWomen, on the other hand, are more likely to cite education percent of women vs. 7 percent of men) as primary reasons for participating in political activities.",
    "answer": "Although past research indicates that female and male politicians focus on different realms, a recent study shows that there is no significant gender difference in various political dimensions, with slight exception that man are more interested in taxes and foreign policy while female politicians tend to focus on education.",

    "content": "Avocados are toxic to almost all animals (including cats and dogs). Humans are a rare exception. It is the only fruit to contain persin, a fatty acid, which, when eaten by animals causes vomiting, diarrhea, and other nasty symptoms. Consumption of large quantities can cause death within twelve hours. Avocados are berries (fleshy fruits coming from a single ovary). Interestingly, this broad definition of a berry means that bananas, pumpkin, tomatoes, watermelon, and coffee are also berries (you can tell that to the next person who tries to argue that tomatoes are vegetables). Curiously this also excludes strawberries as berries. Eighty percent of modern avocados originate from one ‘mother’ tree which was patented by mailman Rudolph Hass from California in 1935. The tree survived until 2002 when it died of root rot. Unfortunately Hass only made $5,000 in his lifetime from his patent on the tree because his partner sold cultivars to anyone who wanted to buy them. Subsequently Hass spent the remainder of his life working for the California Mail Service. Avocado also has an interesting characteristic: it is the only berry with no living animal large enough to spread it through consumption and release as dung. This has led scientists to believe that it co-evolved with prehistoric megafauna that were large enough to eat the fruit whole. The megafauna went extinct but the avocado remained as an unusual monument to an unknown dinosaur.",
    "answer": "Avocado, uniquely toxic to many animals but safe for humans, is technically classified as a berry, with the popular Hass avocado originating from a patented \"mother\" tree, although its inventor Rudolph Hass made little profit from it, it is also the only berry with no living animal large enough to disperse its seeds, suggesting a co-evolution with now-extinct megafauna.

    "content": "Researchers from the University carried out experiments to better understand why dandelion seeds fly so well, despite their parachute structure being largely made up of empty space.\n\nTheir study revealed that a ring-shaped air bubble forms as air moves through the bristles, enhancing the drag that slows each seed’s descent to the ground. This newly found form of air bubble – which the scientists have named the separated vortex ring – is physically detached from the bristles and is stabilised by air flowing through it.\n\nThe amount of air flowing through, which is critical for keeping the bubble stable and directly above the seed in flight, is precisely controlled by the spacing of the bristles. This flight mechanism of the bristly parachute underpins the seeds’ steady flight. It is four times more efficient than what is possible with conventional parachute design, according to the research. Researchers suggest that the dandelion’s porous parachute might inspire the development of small-scale drones that require little or no power consumption. Such drones could be useful for remote sensing or air pollution monitoring.",

The more you understand and know about a situation, the more comfortable you will be and thus the less power your shyness will have over you.\n\nLet’s take for example the subject of public speaking. This is an activity that terrifies most people half to death, but only because most people don’t have much knowledge about it. If you do some research and investigation, you’ll come to learn that it’s perfectly natural to be terrified of public speaking, and that almost every single person has the same fears and insecurities that you do.\n\nWhen you take it further and ask yourself why you are so terrified of this, you’ll come to learn that you are scared of being judged, or of being laughed at. From there, you can go and read and learn about people who are good at public speaking—learn their tips and strategies.\n\nThis way you are much more prepared because your knowledge on the subject is vast. As a result of this, your confidence will already be much higher than before, which might allow you to attempt public speaking when you join a club like Toastmasters. As you practice more, you will naturally become even more confident.\n\nThis rule applies to any area where you feel insecure. Read and research as much about the topic as possible. This will help increase your confidence enough to give the activity a try to see if you might be able to become better at it. And that initial confidence to take action is all you need to get the ball rolling and overcome your shyness.",

    "content": "Males do the singing and females do the listening. This has been the established, even cherished view of courtship in birds, but now some ornithologists are changing tune.\n\nLászló Garamszegi of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, and colleagues studied the literature on 233 European songbird species. Of the 109 for which information on females was available, they found evidence for singing in 101 species. In only eight species could the team conclude that females did not sing.\n\nFemales that sing have been overlooked, the team say, because either their songs are quiet, they are mistaken for males from their similar plumage or they live in less well-studied areas such as the tropics. Garamszegi blames Charles Darwin for the oversight. “He emphasized the importance of male sexual display, and this is what everyone has been looking at.”\n\nThe findings go beyond modern species. After carefully tracing back an evolutionary family tree for their songbirds, Garamszegi’s team discovered that, in at least two bird families, singing evolved in females first. They suggest these ancient females may have been using their songs to deter other females from their territories, to coordinate breeding activities with males, or possibly to attract mates.\n\n“It leaves us with a perplexing question,” says Garamszegi. “What evolutionary forces drove some females to give up singing?”",

In this study, the authors watched what happened when they presented photographs of the same two adults' faces (a man and a woman) to 26 feeding dogs. The images were placed strategically to the sides of the animals' line of sight and the photos showed a human face expressing one of the six basic human emotions: anger, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust or being neutral.\n\nThe dogs showed greater response and cardiac activity when shown photographs that expressed arousing emotional states such as anger, fear and happiness. They also took longer to resume feeding after seeing these images. The dogs' increased heart rate indicated that in these cases they experienced higher levels of stress. In addition, dogs tended to turn their heads to the left when they saw human faces expressing anger, fear or happiness. The reverse happened when the faces looked surprised, possibly because dogs view it as a non-threatening, relaxed expression. These findings, therefore, support the existence of an asymmetrical emotional modulation of dogs' brains to process basic human emotions. ",

It’s a pure, unfiltered and unpasteurized sweetener made by bees from the nectar of flowers. Most of the honey consumed today is processed honey that’s been heated and filtered since it was gathered from the hive. Unlike processed honey, raw honey does not get robbed of its incredible nutritional value and health powers. It can help with everything from low energy to sleep problems to seasonal allergies.

In attempting to explain this phenomenon, some researchers argued that African American parents recognized the need to prepare their children to face not only bullying but also humiliating racist comments and acts from the dominant culture. They frequently emphasized to their children that racist behaviours are wrong and that their children need not feel alone in their struggle. Research on the predominantly or exclusively white communities where the white male middle-class school shooters resided painted a very different picture. Parents and school staff in these areas indicated that they offered little or no opportunity either to stop the intense bullying or to help the victims process the emotions and identify strategies for responding. Because the boys were sometimes ashamed to report these violations of their masculinity, parents and school staff were often ignorant of, or ignored, the daily demoralizing, humiliating, and taunting environments embedded in the school and community cultures where the white school shooters lived. Thus, some future school shooters were left to determine on their own how to negotiate their feelings of intense rejection and discrimination relating to their social standing in their schools and among their peers: they were on their own in defending their sense of self in the context of their often extreme physical and verbal bullying and severe personal humiliation.",

Or, “Once I hit my sales target, I’ll feel great.” But because success is a moving target—as soon as you hit your target, you raise it again—the happiness that results from success is fleeting.\n\nIn fact, it works the other way around: People who cultivate a positive mind-set perform better in the face of challenge. I call this the “happiness advantage”—every business outcome shows improvement when the brain is positive. I’ve observed this effect in my role as a researcher and lecturer in 48 countries on the connection between employee happiness and success. And I’m not alone: In a meta-analysis of 225 academic studies, researchers Sonja Lyubomirsky, Laura King, and Ed Diener found strong evidence of directional causality between life satisfaction and successful business outcomes.\n\nAnother common misconception is that our genetics, our environment, or a combination of the two determines how happy we are. To be sure, both factors have an impact. But one’s general sense of well-being is surprisingly malleable.

    "content": "As a philosopher, mathematician, educator, social critic and political activist, Bertrand Russell authored over 70 books and thousands of essays and letters addressing a myriad of topics. Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, Russell was a fine literary stylist, one of the foremost logicians ever, and a gadfly for improving the lives of men and women.\n\nBorn in 1872 into the British aristocracy and educated at Cambridge University, Russell gave away much of his inherited wealth. But in 1931 he inherited and kept an earldom.\n\nHe was arguably the greatest philosopher of the 20th century and the greatest logician since Aristotle. Analytic philosophy, the dominant philosophy of the twentieth century, owes its existence more to Russell than to any other philosopher. And the system of logic developed by Russell and A.N. Whitehead, based on earlier work by Dedekind, Cantor, Frege, and Peano, broke logic out of its Aristotelian straitjacket. He was also one of the century's leading public intellectuals and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950 \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought.\"\n\nRussell was involved, often passionately, in numerous social and political controversies of his time.

    "content": "In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution created yet another setback for the American wine industry. The National Prohibition Act, also know as the Volstead Act, prohibited the manufacture, sale, transportation, exportation, delivery or possession of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes. Prohibition, which continued for thirteen years, nearly destroyed what had become a thriving and national industry.\n\nOne of the loopholes in the Volstead Act allowed for the manufacture and sale of sacramental wine, medicinal wines for sale by pharmacists with a doctor’s prescription, and medicinal wine tonics (fortified wines) sold without prescription. Perhaps more important, prohibition allowed anyone to produce up to two hundred gallons yearly of fruit juice or cider. The fruit juice, which was sometimes made into concentrate, was ideal for making wine. People would buy grape concentrate from California and have it shipped to the east coast. The top of the container was stamped in big bold letters: Caution: Do not add sugar or yeast or else fermentation will take place! Some of this yield found its way to bootleggers throughout America who did just that. But not for long, because the government stepped in and banned the sale of grape juice, preventing illegal wine production. Vineyards stopped being planted, and the American wine industry came to a halt.",

    "content": "When the Rosetta Stone was discovered in 1799, the carved characters that covered its surface were quickly copied. Printer's ink was applied to the Stone and white paper laid over it. When the paper was removed, it revealed an exact copy of the text—but in reverse. Since then, many copies or \"facsimiles\" have been made using a variety of materials. Inevitably, the surface of the Stone accumulated many layers of material left over from these activities, despite attempts to remove any residue. Once on display, the grease from many thousands of human hands eager to touch the Stone added to the problem.\n\nAn opportunity for investigation and cleaning the Rosetta Stone arose when this famous object was made the centerpiece of the Cracking Codes exhibition at The British Museum in 1999. When work commenced to remove all but the original, ancient material the stone was black with white lettering. As treatment progressed, the different substances uncovered were analysed. Grease from human handling, a coating of carnauba wax from the early 1800s and printer's ink from 1799 were cleaned away using cotton wool swabs and liniment of soap, white spirit, acetone and purified water. Finally, white paint in the text, applied in 1981, which had been left in place until now as a protective coating, was removed with cotton swabs and purified water. A small square at the bottom left corner of the face of the Stone was left untouched to show the darkened wax and the white infill.",

    "content": "For centuries, the legend of Atlantis has captivated the imaginations of historians, archaeologists, and enthusiasts alike. This mythical city, believed to have vanished beneath the waves, has remained an enduring mystery. However, recent research has shed new light on the enigma of Atlantis.\n\nThe story of Atlantis, first recounted by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogues \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias,\" describes an advanced civilization that existed around 9,000 years before his time. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful and technologically advanced island nation, but it was ultimately engulfed by the sea in a cataclysmic event.\n\nFor centuries, scholars debated whether Atlantis was a mere allegory or a real place. The absence of concrete evidence fueled skepticism. However, advances in underwater archaeology and geology have allowed researchers to reexamine the possibility of Atlantis's existence.\n\nOne intriguing theory is that Atlantis was located in the Mediterranean, near what is now the island of Santorini. Around 1600 BCE, the eruption of the Santorini volcano caused massive tsunamis and devastated the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete. Some believe this event may have inspired the Atlantis legend.\n\nAnother hypothesis places Atlantis in the Azores, a group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Geological surveys have revealed submerged structures and unusual stone formations on the seafloor, sparking excitement among those who hope to find conclusive evidence.\n\nWhile the mystery of Atlantis has not been definitively solved, these recent discoveries and ongoing research efforts bring us closer to understanding the ancient legend. Whether Atlantis is a historical reality or a captivating myth, its allure continues to inspire exploration and intrigue in the realms of history and archaeology.",

    "content": "Throughout our lives, we make many memories, some good and others not so pretty. For the ones that we wish we could forget, there may be a way to achieve this. Erasing memories is possible, but you must be willing to go seriously out of your way to achieve your goal.\n\nScientists recently discovered that our memories are not as permanent as we thought. Research on both animals and humans has shown that using drugs like propranolol, a high blood pressure medication, can rewire our brains to the point where we lessen the effects of emotional memories. This research is backed by the discovery that every memory is locked in different connections in your brain. When you form a memory, proteins stimulate specific brain cells to help create new connections.\n\nFor instance, if bikes scare you, it is because you, or someone close to you, had a bad experience with one. As you take your prescription, you will only be scared of bikes without defaulting to the bad experience. Research may also suggest that a placebo (usually a sugar pill that the user believes is the real drug) can alter behaviors that may dissipate the psychosomatic effects of a bad memory.\n\nWhether you should erase your memories is not a straightforward answer. That problem seems like it belongs to the ethics department.",

It can be used to treat a broad variety of mental disorders and emotional difficulties. The goal of psychotherapy is to eliminate or control disabling or troubling symptoms so the patient can function better. Depending on the extent of the problem, treatment may take just a few sessions over a week or two or may take many sessions over a period of years. Psychotherapy can be done individually, as a couple, with a family, or in a group.\n\nThere are many forms of psychotherapy. There are psychotherapies that help patients change behaviors or thought patterns, psychotherapies that help patients explore the effect of past relationships and experiences on present behaviors, and psychotherapies that are tailored to help solve other problems in specific ways. Cognitive behavior therapy is a goal-oriented therapy focusing on problem solving. Psychoanalysis is an intensive form of individual psychotherapy which requires frequent sessions over several years.\n\nMost medications are used by psychiatrists in much the same way that medications are used to treat high blood pressure or diabetes. After completing thorough evaluations, psychiatrists can prescribe medications to help treat mental disorders. While the precise mechanism of action of psychiatric medications is not fully understood, they may beneficially modulate chemical signaling and communication within the brain, which may reduce some symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Patients on long-term medication treatment will need to meet with their psychiatrist periodically to monitor the effectiveness of the medication and any potential side effects.",

During the past decade alone, scientific and technical progress in all fields of brain research has been astonishing. Using new imaging techniques, scientists can visualize the human brain in action. Images produced by these techniques have defined brain regions responsible for attention, memory, and emotion. A series of discoveries (in multiple fields of study) has displaced the long-standing assumption that brain cells are stable and unchanging. Amazingly, new findings show that some adult brain cells can divide and grow! In addition, advances in research are allowing scientists to analyze and make progress toward understanding the causes of inherited brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Taken together, these discoveries provide hope for the recovery of nervous system function lost through injury or disease.\n\nDespite these and other significant advances in the field of brain research, most of the processes responsible for the integrated functioning of billions of brain cells remain a mystery. Research on the brain in the new millennium is crucial to our effort to come to a complete understanding of this fascinating organ. In turn, improved understanding makes the development of new treatment options possible. Research continues to bring new insights into how the brain is put together, how it works, and whether damage to the brain can be reversed.",

    "content": "Consider the current situation: like their counterparts in the United States, engineers and technicians in India have the capacity to provide both computer programming and innovative new technologies. Indian programmers and high-tech engineers earn one-quarter of what their counterparts earn in the United States. Consequently, India is able to do both jobs at a lower dollar cost than the United States: India has an absolute advantage in both. In other words, it can produce a unit of programming for fewer dollars than the United States, and it can also produce a unit of technology innovation for fewer dollars. Does that mean that the United States will lose not only programming jobs but innovation technology jobs, too? Does that mean that our standard of living will fall if the United States and India engage in international trade?\n\nDavid Ricardo would have answered no to both questions –as we do today. While India may have an absolute advantage in both activities, that fact is irrelevant in determining what India or the United States will produce. India has a comparative advantage in doing programming in part because such activity requires little physical capital. The flip side is that the United States has a comparative advantage in technology innovation partly because it is relatively easy to obtain capital in this country to undertake such long-run projects. The result is that Indian programmers will do more and more of what U.S. programmers have been doing in the past. In contract, American firms will shift to more and more innovation. The United States will specialize in technology innovation; India will specialize in programming. The business managers in each country will opt to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage. As in the past, the U.S. economy will continue to concentrate on what are called the “most best” activities.",

    "content": "What is the solution for nations with increasing energy demands, hindered by frequent power cuts and an inability to compete in the international oil market? For East Africa at least, experts think geothermal energy is the answer. More promising still, the Kenyan government and international investors seem to be listening. This is just in time according to many, as claims of an acute energy crisis are afoot due to high oil prices, population spikes and droughts.\n\nCurrently over 60% of Kenya’s power comes from hydroelectric sources but these are proving increasingly unreliable as the issue of seasonal variation is intensified by erratic rain patterns. Alternative energy sources are needed; and the leading energy supplier in Kenya, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), hopes to expand its geothermal energy supply from 13% to 25 % of its total usage by 2020. The potential of geothermal energy in the region was first realised internationally by the United Nations Development Program, when geologists observed thermal anomalies below the East African Rift system. Locals have been utilising this resource for centuries; using steam vents to create the perfect humidity for greenhouses, or simply to enjoy a swim in the many natural hot lakes.\n\nAlong the 6000 km of the rift from the Red Sea to Mozambique, geochemical, geophysical and heat flow measurements were made to identify areas suitable for geothermal wells. One area lies next to the extinct Olkaria volcano, within the Hell’s Gate National Park, and sits over some of the thinnest continental crust on Earth. This is a result of the thinning of the crust by tectonic stretching, causing hotter material below the Earth’s surface to rise, resulting in higher temperatures. This thin crust was ideal for the drilling of geothermal wells, reaching depths of around 3000 m, where temperatures get up to 342°C, far higher than the usual temperature of 90°C at this depth. Water in the surrounding rocks is converted to steam by the heat. The steam can be used to drive turbines and produce electricity.",

Most start using the internet at the average age of three — and as recent research shows, children now spend more time playing and socialising online than watching television programmes.\n\nGiven this change in habits, it is not surprising that a recent House of Lords report has raised online safety and behaviour as an important issue. The report said that for children, learning to survive in a world dominated by the internet should be as important as reading and writing.\n\nThe House of Lords Communications Committee also warned that children should not be leaving school without ‘a well-rounded understanding of the digital world’. It also suggested that the government should think about implementing new legal requirements and a code of conduct companies would have to adhere to, which would help to bring the internet up to ‘child-friendly standards’.\n\nOf course, trying to rectify this lack of child-centred design is not an easy task, but one that requires the cooperation and goodwill of many sectors.

And that nightly dinner doesn’t have to be a gourmet meal that took three hours to cook, nor does it need to be made with organic arugula and heirloom parsnips.\n\nFor starters, researchers found that for young children, dinnertime conversation boosts vocabulary even more than being read aloud to. The researchers counted the number of rare words – those not found on a list of 3,000 most common words – that the families used during dinner conversation. Young kids learned 1,000 rare words at the dinner table, compared to only 143 from parents reading storybooks aloud. Kids who have a large vocabulary read earlier and more easily.\n\nOlder children also reap intellectual benefits from family dinners. For school-age youngsters, regular mealtime is an even more powerful predictor of high achievement scores than time spent in school, doing homework, playing sports or doing art.\n\nOther researchers reported a consistent association between family dinner frequency and teen academic performance.

One of the members is Dr. Holy Shiels, a physiologist and senior lecturer in the Faculty of Life Sciences at the University of Manchester. She will be the only British scientist in the team to study Greenland shark, which is believed to be the vertebrate animals and mammals with the longest living. The shark is reported to have lived for more than 200 years, and possibly close to or more than 400 years. The shark is both hunter and a scavenger, that feed on seals and other animals including polar bears and whales. It is also known as one of the largest sharks, reaching to five and a half meters (18 feet), very close to the size of a great white. The research team is commissioned by the Greenland government and will conduct the research on board the multi-purpose research vessel Sanna, operated by the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. A Greenland shark is estimated to be able to live for 400 years according to Science Magazine. Professor Shiels expects to gather sufficient data of Greenland shark, a top predator in the Arctic sea. She wanted to find a clue of how Greenland shark is able to survive in the deep sea of the Arctic sea, by examining how its heart and circulation work in its normal habitat, as she specializes in the cardiovascular function. “Greenland sharks are classified as data deficient,” Shiels said. “This means that we don’t know enough to put measures in place to protect them from over-fishing, pollution or climate change.”",

    "content": "Many human activities are responsible for the production of greenhouse gases. Generating electricity is the single largest source of CO2 emissions in the United States, followed by transportation. Negative externalities are created by individuals that engage in more than the economically efficient amount of an activity, such as driving. Because the driver enjoys all of the benefits that come along with driving and only suffer part of the cost, they do not put a limit on how far or how often they should drive. The only way to get individuals to participate in reducing greenhouse gases is by having them bear all the costs of their actions. This is difficult because the costs are so little compared to the benefit, so why give up something that benefits more than sets you back. Two different methods are being proposed in order to help humans take into consideration the costs of their actions in order to reduce production of greenhouse gases. The methods proposed are government regulation and taxation. Unless the government sets regulations and taxes, the individual level of involvement will be very low and unless many people participate, the amount of greenhouse gases will not be significantly reduced.",

    "content": "The natural world is a testament to the profound and intricate patterns of growth and change that govern all living things. Whether it's the growth of a towering oak tree or the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly, the rhythms of growth and change are embedded in the very fabric of life. One of the most remarkable aspects of growth is its consistency. In the world of plants, seeds germinate, roots take hold, and shoots emerge, all guided by the innate wisdom of nature. Animals, too, undergo predictable stages of development as they progress from infancy to adulthood. These processes are governed by genetic instructions that ensure the survival and reproduction of species. Change is another fundamental aspect of growth. As living organisms grow, they undergo numerous transformations. For example, the seasons bring about dramatic changes in the natural world. Trees shed their leaves in the fall, only to bud new ones in the spring. Animals molt, migrate, and hibernate in response to changing environmental conditions. The concept of metamorphosis, as seen in the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly, illustrates the marvels of growth and change. This process involves a series of distinct stages, each with a specific purpose. The caterpillar, a voracious eater, prepares for its final transformation by storing energy and building a chrysalis. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis, emerging as a completely different creature with wings that enable it to fly. Ultimately, these patterns of growth and change remind us of the resilience and adaptability of life in the natural world. They highlight the interconnectedness of all living things and the importance of preserving and protecting our environment to ensure the continued growth and evolution of the diverse species that call our planet home.",

    "content": "Working nine to five for a single employer bears little resemblance to the way a substantial share of the workforce makes a living today. Millions of people assemble various income streams and work independently, rather than in structured payroll jobs. This is hardly a new phenomenon, yet it has never been well measured in official statistics—and the resulting data gaps prevent a clear view of a large share of labor-market activity.\n\nTo better understand the independent workforce and what motivates the people who participate in it, the McKinsey Global Institute surveyed some 8,000 respondents across Europe and the United States. We asked about their income in the past 12 months—encompassing primary work, as well as any other income-generating activities—and about their professional satisfaction and aspirations for work in the future.\n\nThe resulting report, Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy, finds that up to 162 million people in Europe and the United States—or 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population—engage in some form of independent work. While demographically diverse, independent workers largely fit into four segments (exhibit): free agents, who actively choose independent work and derive their primary income from it; casual earners, who use independent work for supplemental income and do so by choice; reluctants, who make their primary living from independent work but would prefer traditional jobs; and the financially strapped, who do supplemental independent work out of necessity.",

    "content": "Spurred by the sense that disorderly behavior among students in South Euclid was increasing, the school resource officer (SRO) reviewed data regarding referrals to the principal's office. He found that the high school reported thousands of referrals a year for bullying and that the junior high school had recently experienced a 30 percent increase in bullying referrals. Police data showed that juvenile complaints about disturbances, bullying, and assaults after school hours had increased 90 percent in the past 10 years.\n\nThe SRO worked in close collaboration with a social worker and the university researcher. They coordinated a Response Planning Team comprising many stakeholders that was intended to respond to each of the areas identified in the initial analysis. Environmental changes included modifying the school schedule and increasing teacher supervision of hotspots. Counselors and social workers conducted teacher training courses in conflict resolution and bullying prevention. Parent education included mailings with information about bullying, an explanation of the new school policy, and a discussion about what could be done at home to address the problems. Finally, student education included classroom discussions between homeroom teachers and students, as well as assemblies conducted by the SRO. The SRO also opened a substation next to a primary hotspot. The Ohio Department of Education contributed by opening a new training center to provide a nontraditional setting for specialized help.\n\nThe results from the various responses were dramatic. School suspensions decreased 40 percent. Bullying incidents dropped 60 percent in the hallways and 80 percent in the gym area. Follow-up surveys indicated that there were positive attitudinal changes among students about bullying and that more students felt confident that teachers would take action when a problem arose. Teachers indicated that training sessions were helpful and that they were more likely to talk about bullying as a serious issue. Parents responded positively, asking for more information about the problem in future mailings. The overall results suggest that the school environments were not only safer; but that early intervention was helping at-risk students succeed in school (South Euclid (Ohio) Police Department, 2001).",

    "content": "In our fast-paced and increasingly complex world, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the demands of modern life. However, there is a growing movement that encourages us to embrace simplicity and find joy in the everyday moments.\n\nSimplicity is not about deprivation or austerity; it's about focusing on what truly matters and eliminating unnecessary clutter from our lives. It's about rediscovering the beauty in simplicity, mindfulness, and gratitude.\n\nOne way to embrace simplicity is by decluttering our physical spaces. Marie Kondo's KonMari method, for example, advocates for keeping only the possessions that \"spark joy.\" By tidying up and organizing our surroundings, we create a more peaceful and harmonious environment.\n\nAnother aspect of simplicity is cultivating mindfulness. This means being fully present in the moment, savoring each experience, and appreciating the small pleasures in life. Whether it's enjoying a cup of tea, taking a leisurely walk in nature, or spending quality time with loved ones, mindfulness allows us to connect with the richness of the present.\n\nGratitude is also a key element in finding joy in simplicity. Taking time to acknowledge and appreciate the things we often take for granted can shift our perspective and bring greater happiness. Practicing gratitude reminds us of the abundance in our lives, even during challenging times.\n\nSimplicity does not require a radical overhaul of our lives; it's about making small, intentional choices that align with our values and priorities. By simplifying our lives, we can reduce stress, enhance our well-being, and create space for the experiences and relationships that truly enrich our lives.\n\nIn conclusion, embracing simplicity is a powerful antidote to the complexities of modern life. It invites us to declutter, be mindful, and practice gratitude, ultimately allowing us to find greater joy in the everyday moments and appreciate the beauty in life's simplicity.",

    "content": "Over the years, language teachers have alternated between favoring teaching approaches that focus primarily on language use and those that focus on language forms or analysis. The alternation has been due to a fundamental disagreement concerning whether one learns to communicate in a second language by communicating in that language (such as in an immersion experience) or whether one learns to communicate in a second language by learning the lexicogrammar-the words and grammatical structures-of the target language. In other words, the argument has been about two different means of achieving the same end.\n\nAs with any enduring controversy, the matter is not easily resolved. For one thing, there is evidence to support both points of view. It is not uncommon to find learners who, for whatever reason, find themselves in a new country or a new region of their own country, who need to learn a new language, and who do so without the benefit of formal instruction. If they are postpubescent, they may well retain an accent of some kind, but they can pick up enough language to satisfy their communicative needs. In fact, some are natural acquirers who become highly proficient in this manner. In contrast, there are learners whose entire exposure to the new language comes in the form of classroom instruction in lexicogrammar. Yet they too achieve a measure of communicative proficiency, and certain of these learners become highly proficient as well. What we can infer from this is that humans are amazingly versatile learners and that some people have a natural aptitude for acquiring languages and will succeed no matter what the circumstances.",

    "content": "When people start thinking about language, the first question which often occurs to them is this: is language natural to humans? – in the same way that grunting is natural to pigs, and barking comes naturally to dogs. Or is it just something we happen to have learned? – in the same way that dogs may learn to beg, or elephants may learn to waltz, or humans may learn to play the guitar.\n\nClearly, in one sense, children ‘learn’ whatever language they are exposed to, be it Chinese, Nootka or English. So no one would deny that ‘learning’ is very important. But the crucial question is whether children are born with ‘blank sheets’ in their head as far as language is concerned – or whether humans are ‘programmed’ with an outline knowledge of the structure of languages in general.\n\nThis question of whether language is partly due to nature or wholly due to learning or nurture is often referred to as the nature–nurture controversy, and has been discussed for centuries. For example, it was the topic of one of Plato’s dialogues, the Cratylus. Controversies which have been going on for literally ages tend to behave in a characteristic fashion. They lie dormant for a while, then break out fiercely. This particular issue resurfaced in linguistics in 1959 when the linguist Noam Chomsky wrote a devastating and witty review of Verbal Behavior, a book by the Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner (Skinner 1957; Chomsky 1959). This book claimed to ‘explain’ language as a set of habits gradually built up over the years. According to Skinner, no complicated innate or mental mechanisms are needed. All that is necessary is the systematic observation of the events in the external world which prompt the speaker to utter sounds.",

But how are individuals and countries affected by compulsory voting beyond boosting electoral participation? Shane Singh investigates the social, economic, and political consequences of compelling citizens to vote.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion about compulsory voting these days. In the United Kingdom, in particular, as voter turnout rates have declined, many commentators and politicians have begun advocating for mandatory electoral participation. Those in favour of compulsory voting often adduce the importance of participation among all segments of society. Citizens of democracies are forced to do many things in the interest of the public good, they maintain, including serving on juries and educating their children, and full participation serves the country as whole. Those opposed to compulsory voting often argue that, from a democratic theory perspective, the right to vote implicitly includes a right not to vote.\n\nSuch a right of abstention, they argue, is more important than any societal good that might accompany high turnout. In fact, opponents of compulsory voting often contend that the country may be better off if those who are disinclined to vote are not pushed to participate in public affairs. Regardless of whether one of these sets of arguments is more persuasive than the other, compulsory voting is commonly used around the world. Several European democracies mandate voting, as do Australia and most of the countries in Latin America. By evaluating results from these countries, it is possible to assess the mechanics and effects of compulsory voting.",

Statistics suggest a lifetime estimate of approximately 6.8% for PTSD diagnosis, which is a small portion relative to those who experience trauma. Thus, on average, approximately 7 out of 100 people will go on to develop symptoms associated with PTSD after experiencing a significant traumatic event, with an average estimate of 7.5 million to 8 million people per year developing the disorder.\n\nThe effects of post-traumatic stress can be lifelong, chronic, and highly variable.

    "content": "Brand loyalty exists when consumers repeat-purchase your brand rather than swapping and switching between brands. It is widely agreed that it is far more expensive to have to find a new customer than to keep existing ones happy, so brand loyalty is crucial for achieving high-profit margins. For charities, it is important to set a marketing objective of improving brand loyalty. If existing donors can be persuaded to set up a direct debit to the charity, its cash flow will improve significantly. To enhance, or reposition a brand's image Although some brands stay fresh for generations (Marmite is over 100 years old) others become jaded due to changes in consumer tastes and lifestyles. At this point, the firms need to refresh the brand image to keep the products relevant to the target market. A clear objective must be set. For instance: what brand attributes do we want to create? What do we want the brand to stand for?\n\nThis occurs when a firm aims to a change a brand’s image, so that the brand appeals to a new target market. Twelve years into its life cycle, McVitie's decided to reposition its Hobnobs biscuit brand. Hobnobs had been positioned as a homely, quite healthy biscuit for middle-aged consumers. Research pointed McVitie's in a new direction: younger, more male, and less dull. So new packaging was designed and then launched in conjunction with a new, brighter advertising campaign. In 2013 Hobnobs sales were worth 36 million pounds, 9 percent up on the previous year.",
    "answer": "Except only a few brands that can stay fresh for generations, most companies need to reposition their brand images at some point to hold onto customers and build brand loyalty, this is has been proved by the McVitie's reposition marketing strategies which provided them substantial opportunities to target the biscuits at a wider audience and eventually leaded to growth in market share.",

As our lives become increasingly intertwined with digital platforms, it's essential to recognize and nurture the human relationships that form the foundation of our society.\n\nDespite the convenience and connectivity provided by social media and digital communication tools, there's a growing concern that these virtual interactions often lack depth and authenticity. A simple \"like\" or \"comment\" on a social media post cannot replace the warmth of a smile, the comfort of a hug, or the understanding in a friend's eyes during a face-to-face conversation.\n\nHuman connections are not just about the exchange of information; they are about empathy, shared experiences, and emotional support. They are about listening, understanding, and offering a helping hand when needed. These connections create a sense of belonging and contribute to our overall well-being.\n\nBuilding and nurturing meaningful human relationships require time, effort, and intentionality. It involves being present with others, actively listening, and showing genuine interest in their lives. It involves reaching out to friends and family, strengthening bonds, and creating a support network that can weather life's challenges.\n\nIn a world that often values virtual connections and digital distractions, let us not forget the profound impact of human relationships. As we navigate the digital age, let us make a conscious effort to prioritize genuine human connections, for they are the threads that weave the fabric of our lives, providing comfort, joy, and a sense of belonging in an increasingly complex world.",

    "content": "Promoting active lifestyles can help us address some of the important challenges facing the UK today. Increasing physical activity has the potential to improve the physical and mental health of the nation, reduce all-cause mortality and improve life expectancy. It can also save money by significantly easing the burden of chronic disease on the health and social care services. Increasing cycling and walking will reduce transport costs, save money and help the environment. Fewer car journeys can reduce traffic, congestion and pollution, improving the health of communities. Other potential benefits linked to physical activity in children and young people include the acquisition of social skills through active play (leadership, teamwork and co-operation), better concentration in school and displacement of anti-social and criminal behaviour.\n\nThe importance of physical activity for health was identified over 50 years ago. During the 1950s, comparisons of bus drivers with more physically active bus conductors and office-based telephonists with more physically active postmen demonstrated lower rates of coronary heart disease and smaller uniform sizes in the more physically active occupations. This research led the way for further investigation, and evidence now clearly shows the importance of physical activity in preventing ill health.\n\nIt is important for us to be active throughout our lives. Physical activity is central to a baby’s normal growth and development. This continues through school, and into adulthood and older years. Being physically active can bring substantial benefits and there is consistent evidence of a dose–response relationship, i.e. the greater the volume of physical activity undertaken, the greater the health benefits that are obtained.",
    "answer": "Promoting active lifestyles can improve the wellbeing of both individuals and the nation by easing the financial burden from national welfare and extending human life expectancy, and physical activities are tightly associated with one’s personal development and health condition throughout his life, all of which have been solidly proven by evidence.    ",

    "content": "Instead of a monarch as the chief executive, the U.S. has a president. This American style of democracy is called the \"presidential model,\" since the president is the chief executive and is elected separately from members of Congress. As the head of the executive branch, the president also exercises certain powers, like the ability to veto bills passed by Congress, to appoint members to the Supreme Court, and to serve as commander in chief of the military.\n\nThe second major type of modern democracy is the \"parliamentary model,\" in which the people don't vote directly for the chief executive. Instead, they vote for the members of Parliament, and whichever political party wins a majority of seats in Parliament gets to choose the chief executive, who is called the prime minister. The prime minister is usually the head of the political party in power.\n\nOne major difference between presidential and parliamentary democracies is that parliamentary systems have fewer checks on power, since the executive and legislative branches are controlled by the same party. That means that there's generally less gridlock in parliamentary politics, which is great for the party in power, but less so for the minority opposition.\n\nWhether it's a presidential or parliamentary system, what makes a modern democracy a true democracy is faithful adherence to a set of democratic principles: the rule of law (constitutionalism), representation based on free and fair elections, and guaranteed rights including freedom of speech, press and religion. By that measure, some countries are democracies in name, but not in practice.",

Staff at the insurance company Aetna will get $300 a year added to their salary if they get at least seven hours of sleep a night. That works out to just over an extra dollar for each night the employee sleeps over seven hours. The idea behind this scheme is employee performance. Human resources officials say employees will work better if they have slept well. They add that a workforce that is more awake and alert will mean the company will perform better. Staff can either record their sleep automatically using a wrist monitor that connects to Aetna's computers, or manually record how long they have slept every night.\n\nThere are a number of studies that warn that not sleeping enough can affect our ability to do our job. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine said that the average worker in the USA loses 11.3 working days of productivity a year because of not getting enough sleep. This costs companies about $2,280 for one worker. It estimates that the US economy loses $63.2 billion a year because workers do not sleep more than seven hours a night. A 2015 study in Europe by the Rand Corporation found that staff who slept less than seven hours per night were far less productive than workers who had eight or more hours of sleep. The staff at Aetna also receive extra cash if they do exercise.",

We juggle work, family, social commitments, and personal interests, often leaving us feeling overwhelmed and stressed. However, achieving balance is essential for our well-being and overall happiness. One key aspect of balance is time management. Prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and creating a schedule that allocates time for work, relaxation, and personal pursuits can help restore equilibrium. Learning to say no when necessary and avoiding overcommitment is also crucial. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is equally vital. Allowing time for rest, relaxation, and quality time with loved ones can prevent burnout and nurture our relationships. Unplugging from digital devices periodically and setting boundaries for work-related communication outside of office hours can further promote balance. Physical well-being is another integral component. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep are foundational to maintaining physical health. These habits not only boost energy levels but also reduce stress and enhance overall life satisfaction. Mental and emotional balance involves mindfulness practices such as meditation and self-reflection. These techniques help us stay centered, manage stress, and develop emotional resilience. Furthermore, nurturing our passions and hobbies is essential. Engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment can counterbalance the demands of daily life. In conclusion, finding balance in modern life is an art that requires conscious effort and self-awareness. By prioritizing time management, work-life balance, physical health, mental well-being, and personal passions, we can create a harmonious and fulfilling life. Balancing our responsibilities with self-care ultimately leads to a happier, healthier, and more satisfying existence.",

    "content": "Antarctica is a land mass located around the South Pole and it has more ice than any other place on Earth. In fact, 99.5 percent of its land mass is covered in ice. During Arctic winter, the ice sheet covering the continent gets even bigger. Antarctica is our fifth largest continent, at 5.4 million square miles, coming in between South America and Europe. Its shape is roughly circular, with one arm reaching out toward South America. This is why many trips to Antarctica are via Argentina.\n\nEven during its warmest period (November to February), Antarctica's temperatures mostly stay below freezing. During the winter, they can drop as low as minus 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The continent receives little precipitation and its snow is dry and powdery. Its constant strong and blustery winds can reach speeds of 200 miles per hour.\n\nNaturally inhospitable to humans and most animals, Antarctica wasn't even formally explored until the 19th century. Today, though, many scientists and researchers call Antarctica their temporary home, living in special facilities while they study the ecosystem and native life.\n\nWhat kind of life is there on Antarctica? The harsh climate and landscape isn't kind to most land animal life. The sea, though, is a different story. The southern oceans are full of nutrients and protein. The abundant food sources sustain many species, including whales, sea birds, seals and more. The most famous ambassador of Antarctica is the penguin, a bird that lives in colonies on the Antarctica shores and feeds from the sea.\n\nSince Antarctica has no human inhabitants, many nations have laid claim to it, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Great Britain, New Zealand and Norway. However, the terms of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 state that the continent is reserved purely for scientific research. This also keeps Antarctica a war-free and nuclear-free zone. Currently, 47 countries have signatures on the treaty.",

    "content": "Saunas are part of a toasty tradition that is as entwined with Finland as the snow that falls there. Saunas originated as sterile ways to \"wash up\" before running hot water existed. The word sauna is actually a Finnish word that translates into English as \"bath.\" The first Finnish saunas were dug into ridges in the ground, and later were built above ground from wooden logs. Rocks were heated until in a stone stove using a wood fire. But these first sauna rooms didn't have chimneys and bathers would have to wait until the rooms cleared of smoke. Finally saunas evolved to what we know today: They're traditionally heated by metal stoves and can reach temperatures as hot as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters in Finland can last up to seven months in the northernmost regions; hence the need for extremely hot saunas. But what about that cold plunge? Well it provides an equally extreme way to cool off. As the Finland tourism board describes it: \"When you come out of the sauna, jump into a lake, or roll in the snow. If you do roll in the snow, make sure it is fresh and powdery: old, icy snow can have an effect on your skin like sandpaper.\" Rolling in the snow sans clothes may sound like the worst spa experience ever.",
    "answer": "The tradition of saunas in Finland, rooted in the Finnish word \"sauna,\" has evolved from ancient dug-in saunas to today's metal stove saunas, offering a contrast to the country's lengthy winters, with a unique practice of cooling off through cold plunges or snow rolls.",

    "content": "The people of Thailand have chewed the illegal kratom leaf for a cheap high for hundreds of years. The drug is thought to be no more dangerous than drinking coffee, but has been outlawed in Thailand for 70 years because the government worried that the chewing of kratom leaves would interfere with taxes derived from the sale of opium.\n\nKratom is a tree in the coffee family found throughout Southeast Asia, particularly in Thailand. Its leaves are mildly psychoactive and have been chewed by Thai people for generations. The high produced by the leaves has been described as giving a coffee-like stimulation in low doses and a euphoric, sedative feeling in higher doses. Curiously, kratom is almost entirely used by men.\n\nAlthough the potential long-term effects have not been widely studied, kratom seems generally harmless and is legal in most of the world, often pulverized and sold in pill form like herbal supplements. There is evidence that kratom can help those addicted to opiates such as heroin wean themselves off of drugs, much like methadone.\n\nDespite the relatively innocuous nature of the plant, it has been illegal to grow or consume kratom in Thailand since 1943. The substance is grouped alongside marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms according to the 1979 Thai Narcotics Act. This is not out of any concern for the people, but rather because the government feared the consumption of kratom, which is cheap and grows naturally, would cut into the tax revenue they made from selling opium. The use or distribution of kratom generally involves a short prison sentence and a fine.",

    "content": "In today's fast-paced world, nurturing strong parent-child bonds and maintaining healthy family relationships can be challenging but is more crucial than ever. Quality time spent together plays a vital role in fostering meaningful connections within the family. First and foremost, communication is the cornerstone of a strong parent-child relationship. Engaging in open and honest conversations allows parents to understand their children's thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Active listening is equally essential, as it conveys empathy and validation of the child's experiences. Quality time also involves shared activities that promote bonding and create lasting memories. Whether it's cooking together, playing games, going for a nature walk, or even just watching a movie, these shared experiences help build trust and strengthen the parent-child connection. Moreover, setting aside time for one-on-one interactions is essential. Spending individual time with each child allows for personalized attention and helps children feel valued and understood. It's an opportunity for parents to show genuine interest in their child's interests and passions. Consistency is key in nurturing family relationships. Establishing routines, such as family meals or bedtime rituals, provides a sense of stability and predictability. These routines create a safe and secure environment for children, allowing them to thrive emotionally and socially. In addition, setting boundaries and rules within the family unit is important. Clear expectations and consequences help children understand limits and develop a sense of responsibility. It's essential to strike a balance between discipline and nurturing to create a supportive and loving atmosphere. Ultimately, the quality of time spent together, rather than quantity, is what matters most. Focusing on meaningful interactions, active listening, shared experiences, and individual attention fosters strong parent-child bonds and promotes a harmonious family life.",

    "content": "For generations, bubbles have sparked the curiosity and imagination of children and adults alike. They love to blow them, pop them and fit inside them. Bubbles aren't just for entertainment; they are the crisp effervescence in our sodas and sparkling water, and some doctors are even using microscopic bubbles to deliver medicine more effectively. Whether for entertainment or scientific study, scientists have been turning their attention to why bubbles pop.\n\nFor many years, it was believed that bubbles popped because of gravity. When a hole is poked in a bubble, the hole expands over time, and the bubble collapses. Because the hole wasn't growing as fast as the bubble was shrinking, scientists chalked it up to gravity.\n\nThere are two primary reasons a bubble will pop. First, because it gets poked, as we mentioned above. When a bubble is poked, a hole forms and surface tension causes the molecules to shrink so quickly that the bubble flattens or bursts and the water escapes as tiny droplets.\n\nThe second reason a bubble pops is because its water evaporates. Because the film around bubbles contains water, it will evaporate over time. Suppose a bubble manages to escape the pursuit of a stick-wielding child. In that case, it will eventually pop once the water evaporates, i.e., it turns into a gas and breaks those molecular bonds that create the surface tension. The more viscous a solution, the longer it takes for water to evaporate. Water also evaporates faster when the air temperature is higher, so bubbles pop more quickly on a warm day than on a cooler one.",
    "answer": "Bubbles captivate both children and adults, with reasons for their popping attributed to two main causes: when they're punctured and the hole expands, leading to the bubble's collapse, or when the water within the bubble gradually evaporates, causing it to burst, with evaporation occurring more quickly in warmer temperatures.",

    "content": "Although we tend to think of electric cars as being something completely modern, they were in fact some of the earliest types of motorized vehicle.\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century electric cars were actually more popular than cars with an internal combustion engine as they were more comfortable to ride in. However, as cars fueled by petrol increased in importance, electric cars declined. The situation became such that electric vehicles were only used for certain specific purposes - as fork-lift trucks, ambulances and urban delivery vehicles, for example.\n\nAlthough electricity declined in use in road vehicles, it steadily grew in importance as a means of powering trains. Switzerland, for example, was quick to develop an electrified train system, encouraged in this no doubt by the fact that it had no coal or oil resources of its own.\n\nNowadays there is renewed interest in electricity as a means of powering road vehicles. Why is this the case? Well, undoubtedly economic reasons are of considerable importance. The cost of oil has risen so sharply that there is a strong financial imperative to look for an alternative. However, there are also environmental motivations. Emissions from cars are blamed in large part for - among other things – the destruction of the ozone layer and the resultant rise in temperatures in the polar regions. A desire not to let things get any worse is also encouraging research into designing effective electric transport.",

    "content": "Warmer temperatures affect the hydrological cycle. The hydrological cycle, also known as the water cycle, is a process that helps with the constant circulation of water between the earth and its atmosphere. In the cycle, evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, condensation and runoff take place. These increase and decrease water availability.\n\nEvaporation occurs when warm temperatures heat the water on Earth, turning them into vapors that rise into the atmosphere. The same process happens in plants, but it is known as transpiration. Warm temperatures cause plants to lose water as vapor.\n\nVapor from the Earth’s surface rises to the atmosphere, where temperatures are cooler. Cooler temperatures cause condensation, turning the water vapor into liquid water. This then falls back to Earth as precipitation in many forms, including rain, snow and hail. Depending on the intensity of the precipitation, runoff may occur. Severe runoff from rain can cause serious floods.\n\nThe water cycle is heavily dependent on temperature. Climate change, which causes warmer temperatures, intensifies the water cycle. Warmer temperatures cause dry areas to lose water faster, creating more extreme drought events, while wet regions experience excessive rainfall. We are now facing an increasing risk of frequent, extreme precipitation and floods.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that intense precipitation will cause an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events. Additionally, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reports that rainfall will reduce in dry areas and frequency will increase in storm-affected areas.\n",

    "content": "The age-old question of whether human traits are determined by nature or nurture has been answered, a team of researchers say. Their conclusion? It’s a draw. By collating almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years, researchers determined that the average variation for human traits and disease is 49 percent due to genetic factors and 51 percent due to environmental factors.\n\nUniversity of Queensland researcher Beben Benyamin from the Queensland Brain Institute collaborated with researchers at VU University of Amsterdam to collate 2,748 studies involving more than 14.5 million pairs of twins. “Twin studies have been conducted for more than 50 years but there is still some debate in terms of how much the variation is due to genetic or environmental factors,” Benyamin said.\n\nHe said the study showed the conversation should move away from nature versus nurture, instead looking at how the two work together. “Both are important sources of variation between individuals,” he said. While the studies averaged an almost even split between nature and nurture, there was wide variation within the 17,800 separate traits and diseases examined by the studies. For example, the risk for bipolar disorder was found to be 68 percent due to genetics and only 32 percent due to environmental factors. Weight maintenance was 63 percent due to genetics and 37 percent due to environmental factors. In contrast, risk for eating disorders was found to be 40 percent genetic and 60 percent environmental, whereas the risk for mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol was 41 percent genetic and 59 percent environmental.\n\nBenyamin said in psychiatric, ophthalmological and skeletal traits, genetic factors were a larger influence than environmental factors. But for social values and attitudes it was the other way around.",
    "answer": "By analyzing 2,748 twin studies, researchers determined that human traits and diseases are shaped by a nearly equal combination of genetic and environmental factors, this balanced influence varies across traits, with genetics playing a larger role in certain areas including psychiatric and ophthalmological traits, while environmental factors are more significant in social values, highlighting the interplay between nature and nurture.",

    "content": "There are always headlines when a blood moon is coming, but they don't always explain what a blood moon is — and how it differs from a lunar eclipse. A blood moon is the same thing as a total lunar eclipse (one of three types of lunar eclipses that can be seen from Earth). Whenever you read a news story about an upcoming blood moon — or see beautiful pictures of one that has just happened — the scientifically accurate term for what you're seeing is a total lunar eclipse.\n\nTo help make more sense of the blood moon phenomena, it helps to understand how eclipses work. An eclipse occurs any time one celestial body (such as Earth or the moon) passes in between the sun and another celestial body and casts a shadow on that other object. In the case of a lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the sun and the moon and our shadow is cast onto the moon.\n\nHowever, it's even more complex: There are two different parts to a shadow. There's the penumbra, the partially shaded outer region of the shadow, and the umbra, the fully shaded inner region of a shadow. The penumbra is the lighter area that causes your shadow to appear fuzzy on the ground on a sunny day; the umbra is the darker area of your shadow.\n\nGiven all that, we can now make sense of the kind of lunar eclipse that creates a blood moon or a total lunar eclipse. When the moon passes completely into the Earth's umbra, it is in our shadow and appears with a reddish tint.",
    "answer": "A \"blood moon\" is essentially a total lunar eclipse, wherein Earth passes between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow with two parts, the penumbra (lighter outer region) and the umbra (darker inner region), causing the moon to appear reddish when fully within Earth's umbra during the eclipse.",

    "content": "The feature of being “double blind”, where neither patients nor physicians are aware of who receives the experimental treatment, is almost universally trumpeted as being a virtue of clinical trials. Hence, trials that fail to remain successfully double blind are regarded as providing inferior evidential support. The rationale for this view is unobjectionable: double blinding rules out the potential confounding influences of patient and physician beliefs. Nonetheless, viewing double blind trial as necessarily superior is problematic. For one, it leads to the paradox that very effective experimental treatments will not be supportable by best evidence. If a new drug were to make even the most severe symptoms of the common cold disappear within seconds, most participants and investigators would correctly identify it as the latest wonder drug and not the control (i.e. placebo) treatment. Any trial testing the effectiveness of this wonder drug will therefore fail to remain double blind. Similar problems arise for treatments, such as exercise and most surgical techniques, whose nature makes them resistant to being tested in double blind conditions. It seems strange that an account of evidence should make a priori judgments that certain claims can never be supported by ‘best evidence’. It would be different if the claims at issue were pseudoscientific – untestable. But so far as treatments with large effects go, the claim that they are effective is highly testable and intuitively they should receive greater support from the evidence than do claims about treatments with moderate effects.",
    "answer": "Double Blind is globally regarded as being a virtue of clinical trials but fail to provide superior evidential support sometimes, this is because that there is not sufficient evidence to effectively verify experimental treatments, and similar problems arise for treatments as some conditions such as exercise make the effectiveness of drugs as untestable, despite the fact that treatment with larger effects is highly testable and should be greatly supportable by best evidence.",

    "content": "Poison pills were developed in the early 1980s as a defense tactic against corporate raiders to effectively poison their takeover efforts, sort of reminiscent of the suicide pills that spies supposedly swallow if captured. There are many variants of poison pills, but they generally increase the number of shares, which then dilutes the bidder's stake and causes them a significant financial loss. Let's say a company has 1,000 shares outstanding valued at $10 each, which means the company has a market value of $10,000. An activist investor purchases 100 shares at the cost of $1,000 and accumulates a significant 10 percent stake in the company. But if the company has a poison pill that is triggered once any hostile bidder owns 10 percent of its stock, all other shareholders would suddenly have the opportunity to buy additional shares at a discounted price, say, half the market price. This has the effect of quickly diluting the activist investor's original stake and also making it worth a lot less than it was before. Twitter adopted a similar measure. If any shareholder accumulates a 15 percent stake in the company in a purchase not approved by the board of directors, other shareholders would get the right to buy additional shares at a discount, diluting the 9.2 percent stake Musk recently purchased. Poison pills are useful in part because they can be adopted quickly, but they usually have expiration dates. The poison pill adopted by Twitter, for example, expires in one year.",

One of the most unique and transformative events in recent Maasai history has been the introduction of the Maasai Olympics, an initiative that combines sportsmanship with the preservation of cultural heritage.\n\nTraditionally, Maasai warriors gained honor and prestige through acts of bravery, such as lion hunting. However, as wildlife conservation efforts intensified and lion populations declined, there was a growing need to find alternative ways to demonstrate valor and leadership within the community.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the Maasai Olympics was born. This biennial event showcases athletic skills in sports like running, spear throwing, and high jump, all inspired by traditional warrior training. The twist is that instead of hunting lions, participants now compete to protect them, as the Maasai people have recognized the importance of wildlife conservation.\n\nThe Maasai Olympics not only provides a platform for young warriors to display their physical prowess but also promotes environmental conservation and raises awareness about the importance of preserving Africa's wildlife. It sends a powerful message that cultural heritage and wildlife conservation can go hand in hand.\n\nThis unique event has not only gained attention within Maasai communities but has also garnered international recognition. It exemplifies how innovative approaches can honor tradition while adapting to the changing times. The Maasai Olympics serves as an inspiring example of how culture, sports, and environmental stewardship can intersect to create a positive impact in the modern world.\n\nIn conclusion, the Maasai Olympics represents a significant shift in Maasai culture, where the preservation of tradition and wildlife conservation coalesce in a powerful and meaningful way. This event showcases how indigenous communities can adapt and thrive while maintaining their cultural roots and contributing to global conservation efforts.",

    "content": "Mammals can be one of the hardest-hit groups by habitat loss, and a lot of research has been carried out to find the best ways to conserve mammal diversity.\n\nMuch of this research has focussed on very large-scale changes in land use and the impacts this will have on overall mammal diversity. However, many important decisions about land use are made at much more local scales, for example at the level of individual landowners.\n\nNow, in a detailed study led by Imperial College London that looked at mammal diversity across different small-scale landscapes in Borneo, researchers have identified previously logged forests as an overlooked source of refuge for mammals.\n\nThese ‘selectively logged’ forests, where only certain tree species are removed, are often considered to be degraded and are frequently cleared to make way for plantations. The new results, published in the journal Ecological Applications, suggest they should be better protected.\n\nThe team recorded mammals using trap-and-release techniques and motion-sensing cameras over three years, creating an unprecedented 20,000 records of species in three land-use types: old-growth forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. This is one of the most intensive studies of rainforest mammal diversity ever undertaken.\n\nTo their surprise, they found that mammal diversity for large mammals, like the clouded leopard and civets, was similar for both old-growth forests and logged forests. For small mammals, such as squirrels and rodents, the diversity was actually higher in logged forests.",

The people were hunter-gatherers who lived exclusively from what they could find in nature without practicing either agriculture or herding. They hunted the bigger herbivores, while berries, leaves, roots, wild fruit and mushrooms probably played a major role in their diet. Their hunting was indiscriminate, perhaps because so many animals were about that they did not need to spare pregnant females or the young.\n\nIn the cave of Enlène, for example, many bones of reindeer and bison foetuses were found. Apparently, Upper Palaeolithic people hunted like other predators and killed the weakest prey first. They did, however, sometimes concentrate on salmon runs and migrating herds of reindeer.\n\nContrary to popular beliefs about ‘cave men’, Upper Palaeolithic people did not live deep inside caves. They rather chose the foot of cliffs, especially when an overhang provided good shelter. On the plains and in the valleys, they used tents made from hides of the animals they killed. At times, on the great Russian plains, they built huts with huge bones and tusks collected from the skeletons of mammoths.",

    "content": "The field of personalized medicine, an approach that tailors medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient, has made significant strides in recent years, revolutionizing the way we approach healthcare. This innovative medical model takes into account differences in people's genes, environments, and lifestyles, moving away from the traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to treatment. Central to this advancement is the integration of genomic medicine, which utilizes genetic information to guide the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. For instance, cancer therapy has been transformed by personalized medicine, allowing doctors to select treatments based on the genetic makeup of an individual's tumor. This approach can increase the efficacy of treatment while reducing side effects, as medications can be tailored to how a patient's body will likely respond. Another key aspect of personalized medicine is the use of biomarkers - biological molecules found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues - which provide a snapshot of a person's health. Biomarkers can predict the risk of disease, confirm a diagnosis, or monitor the progress of treatment, thereby improving patient care. Personalized medicine also extends to preventive health. With genetic testing, individuals can understand their susceptibility to certain diseases and take proactive steps to prevent them. This approach not only enhances patient outcomes but also can lead to cost savings in the healthcare system by reducing unnecessary treatments and hospitalizations. In conclusion, personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift in healthcare. By focusing on the individual's unique genetic and biological makeup, it offers a more effective, efficient, and patient-centered approach to diagnosis and treatment. As research and technology continue to advance, personalized medicine is set to play an increasingly vital role in the future of healthcare.",

    "content": "Elizabeth Blackwell's journey to becoming the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States is a story of resilience and determination in the face of immense obstacles. Born in 1821 in Bristol, England, Blackwell moved to the United States with her family at a young age. Her interest in medicine was sparked by a dying friend who expressed that a female physician would have made her medical experience less traumatic.\n\nDespite widespread prejudice against women in medicine at the time, Blackwell was undeterred. She applied to several medical schools, facing rejection after rejection. Finally, she was admitted to Geneva Medical College in New York, where she graduated first in her class in 1849, breaking barriers for women in the field of medicine.\n\nBlackwell's contributions extended beyond her personal achievements. She was an ardent advocate for women in medicine, establishing the New York Infirmary for Women and Children with her sister, Dr. Emily Blackwell, and Dr. Marie Zakrzewska. This institution not only provided medical care to the underserved but also offered training and experience for women medical practitioners.\n\nBlackwell also authored several books, including \"The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls,\" advocating for women's health and education. Her efforts paved the way for generations of women in medicine, challenging societal norms and opening doors for future female physicians.\n\nElizabeth Blackwell's legacy is one of courage, tenacity, and dedication to advancing the role of women in medicine. Her groundbreaking achievements serve as a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of challenging the status quo in pursuit of equality and progress in healthcare.",

    "content": "The data showed that as the temperature increased, air density decreased, causing takeoff speeds to slow down. Over time, this has had a clear effect on air travel. For the Q400 turboprop aircraft at Chios airport, the researchers charted that the average takeoff distance is 328 feet (100 meters) longer now than it was in 1974. This can present real problems for terminals that use shorter runways.\n\nGuy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at England's Cranfield University and one of the authors of the 2020 study, asserts that many air traffic controllers may not have been aware of this effect. \"I don't think that most are noticing the trends of climate change because their job is to plan each day's flights based upon the latest observations and forecasts. You really need to observe changes over at least a decade, as we did with our paper, before the average impacts become noticeable and significant.\"\n\nAside from lengthening runways, air travel experts have to drop vehicle weights to fight the air density problem. This likely means reducing the number of passengers and the amount of cargo allowed on an aircraft. The 2020 study found that at Chios, the maximum allowable takeoff mass was reduced from about 165,350 pounds (75,000 kilograms) in 1974, to 152,000 pounds (69,000 kilograms) in 2017. That's an 8 percent drop in carrying capacity over time. In the case of heatwaves, we've already seen airlines have to cancel tickets or ground flights entirely as a result of the hot air.",

    "content": "Some \"moments\" seem more important in hindsight than they were at the time. David Day, for example, looks at John Curtin's famous \"Australia looks to America\" statement of December 1941, a moment remembered as embodying a fundamental shift in Australia's strategic alliance away from Britain towards the US. As Day points out, the shift to the US as our primary ally was a long, drawn-out process which occurred over half a century. Curtin's statement is iconic - it represents and symbolizes the shift - but in and of itself it made almost no difference. Russell McGregor makes similar arguments with regard to the 1967 referendum, falsely hailed in our memories as a huge advance in Aboriginal rights.\n\nThere are many other important events which our contributors examine - the campaign to save the Franklin River; the landings at Gallipoli, the discovery of gold in 1851, the disastrous Premiers' Plan designed to cope with the Great Depression, to name just a few.\n\nTaken together, our contributors show that narrative approaches to Australian history are not as simple as might be imagined. There is of course the issue of what should be included and what should not be - what, after all, makes a moment or an event sufficiently important to be included in an official narrative? Just as importantly, the moments and events that are included in narrative histories are open to multiple interpretations.\n\nWe hope this collection will provide an important reminder to those wanting to impose a universal history curriculum for our schoolchildren, and indeed a lesson to all Australians wishing to understand their nation's past; History is never simple or straightforward, and it always resists attempts to make it so.",

    "content": "What Makes It Muggy?\n\nLike the heat index, muggy is a \"feels-like\" condition, except it has to do more with how \"breathable\" the air feels than how hot it feels. The muggier the weather, the less chance you'll feel cool because of decreased evaporation rates, which is why the following weather conditions are notoriously linked to the muggiest of days and nights:\n\nWarm air temperatures, generally of 70°F or above (the warmer the air, the more moisture it's able to hold); High moisture (the more moisture there is in the air, the \"heavier\" it feels); and low winds (the less wind there is, the fewer air molecules there are passing over your skin evaporating and cooling you off). \n\nSince mugginess expresses how moist the air feels, you might think that relative humidity would be a good indicator of how muggy it feels outside. However, dew point temperature is actually a better measure of mugginess. Why? Dewpoint not only gives you an indication of how moist air is, but how warm it is as well (since dew point temperature can go as high as, but never higher than the actual air temperature). So if the dew point is high, it means both air moisture and temperature probably are, too.",

    "content": "In a study in the current issue of the journal PLoS One, a team of scientists in Germany showed experts and novices simple geometric objects and simple chess positions and asked the subjects to identify them.\n\nReaction times were measured and brain activity was monitored using functional M.R.I. scans. On the identification of the geometric objects, the subjects performed the same, showing that the chess experts had no special visualization skills. When the subjects were shown the chess positions, the experts identified them faster.\n\nFocusing on an element of an earlier study on pattern and object recognition by chess experts, the researchers had expected to see parts of the left hemispheres of the experts’ brains — which are involved in object recognition — react more quickly than those of the novices when they performed the chess tasks. But the reaction times were the same.\n\nWhat set the experts apart was that parts of their right brain hemispheres — which are more involved in pattern recognition — also lit up with activity. The experts were processing the information in two places at once.\n\nThe researchers also found that when the subjects were shown the chess diagrams, the novices looked directly at the pieces to recognize them, while the experts looked on the middle of the boards and took everything in with their peripheral vision.",

    "content": "Ethics is a set of moral obligations that define right and wrong in our practices and decisions. Many professions have a formalized system of ethical practices that help guide professionals in the field. For example, doctors commonly take the Hippocratic Oath, which, among other things, states that doctors \"do no harm\" to their patients. Engineers follow an ethical guide that states that they \"hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.\" Within these professions, as well as within science, the principles become so ingrained that practitioners rarely have to think about adhering to the ethic – it's part of the way they practice. And a breach of ethics is considered very serious, punishable at least within the profession (by revocation of a license, for example) and sometimes by the law as well.\n\nScientific ethics calls for honesty and integrity in all stages of scientific practice, from reporting results regardless to properly attributing collaborators. This system of ethics guides the practice of science, from data collection to publication and beyond. As in other professions, the scientific ethic is deeply integrated into the way scientists work, and they are aware that the reliability of their work and scientific knowledge in general depends upon adhering to that ethic. Many of the ethical principles in science relate to the production of unbiased scientific knowledge, which is critical when others try to build upon or extend research findings. The open publication of data, peer review, replication, and collaboration required by the scientific ethic all help to keep science moving forward by validating research findings and confirming or raising questions about results.",

If authenticated, the preserved frog would be the first of its kind found in Mexico, according to David Grimaldi, a biologist and curator at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the find.\n\nThe chunk of amber containing the frog, less than half an inch long, was uncovered by a miner in Mexico's southern Chiapas state in 2005 and was bought by a private collector, who lent it to scientists for study. A few other preserved frogs have been found in chunks of amber a stone formed by ancient tree sap mostly in the Dominican Republic. Like those, the frog found in Chiapas appears to be of the genus Craugastor, whose descendants still inhabit the region, said biologist Gerardo Carbot of the Chiapas Natural History and Ecology Institute. Carbot announced the discovery this week.\n\nThe scientist said the frog lived about 25 million years ago, based on the geological strata where the amber was found. Carbot would like to extract a sample from the frog's remains in hopes of finding DNA that could identify the particular species, but doubts the owner would let him drill into the stone. Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History called the idea of extracting DNA \"highly, highly unlikely,\" given that as other scientists have noted genetic material tends to break down over time. But George O. Poinar, an entomologist at Oregon State University who founded the Amber Institute, said extracting DNA is theoretically possible. \"If it's well-preserved and none of the frog has been exposed to the outside, where air could enter in and oxidize the DNA, it could be possible to get DNA.\"",

    "content": "Today's school buses have been designed for better crash and rollover protection. They protect kids through \"compartmentalization,\" which means spacing seats close together, as well as using seats with high, energy-absorbing backs to prevent children from being tossed around in a collision.\n\nSchool buses are also highly visible and have safety features like red flashing red lights, cross-view mirrors and stop-sign arms. Drivers stay on carefully planned routes and maintain slow speeds, so seat belts aren't needed. That's the thought, anyway.\n\nUnfortunately, though, deadly school bus crashes happen. Such was the case in November 2016 when a crash in Chattanooga, Tennessee killed six elementary school students. After another deadly school bus crash in May 2018 in Morris County, New Jersey, killed two, including a child, and injured 43 others, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a full investigation into school bus safety.\n\nHowever, today seat belts are only federally mandated on small school buses, or those weighing 10,000 pounds or less. States are allowed to decide whether to mandate them by law on the rest of school buses. Currently only eight states have laws requiring seat belts on large school buses, though many others are considering similar legislation.\n\nSince most school buses are on the road for at least 10 and often up to 20 years, it's unlikely school districts would choose to retrofit older buses at that cost, which means it would potentially take decades for new legislation requiring seat belts to take effect across a fleet as new buses slowly replace older ones.",

That’s way less than the 25 to 30 grams that’s recommended.\n\nThere are so many reasons why, from fast-food marketing to agriculture subsidies, but one contributing factor is the slow death of cooking, and the rise of the restaurant meal. Americans now spend more on food at restaurants than they do at grocery stores, but restaurant food tends to have even less fiber than the food we would otherwise eat at home.\n\nOne problem seems to be that restaurant meals aren’t typically loaded with two of the best sources of fiber, unprocessed fruits and vegetables. A revealing study from 2007, in which researchers interviewed 41 restaurant executives, showed that restaurants think fruits and vegetables are too expensive to feature prominently on the menu, and “61 percent said profits drive menu selections.” They also opposed labeling certain menu items as healthier choices, saying that would be “the kiss of death.”\n\nSo people like to eat out, and when they do, they prefer mushy, fiber-free comfort foods. But that’s a pretty dangerous road to go down.",

Kinesiology studies the mechanics of the human body in much the same way that auto mechanics study the different parts of vehicles. Just as a flat tire or a blown fuse can affect the entire functioning of a car, things like poor joint mobility or muscle endurance can have an effect on a person’s overall mental and physical health.\n\nBy understanding the intricate functioning of the body, kinesiology provides the ‘big picture’ of how different body functions work together to produce a range of movement. As a field of study, kinesiology explores how the science of movement can impact people on physical, psychological and even sociological levels.\n\nMany colleges and universities offer kinesiology as a major, as its wide range of applications have made it an increasingly popular field of study. According to Niche, some of the top kinesiology degrees in the United States are offered by schools like Rice University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.

    "content": "Manufacturing is no longer simply about making physical products. Changes in consumer demand, the nature of products, the economics of production, and the economics of the supply chain have led to a fundamental shift in the way companies do business. Customers demand personalization and customization as the line between consumer and creator continues to blur. Added sensors and connectivity turn “dumb” products into “smart” ones, while products increasingly become platforms—and even move into the realm of services.\n\nAs technology continues to advance exponentially, barriers to entry, commercialization, and learning are eroding. New market entrants with access to new tools can operate at much smaller scale, enabling them to create offerings once the sole province of major incumbents. While large-scale production will always dominate some segments of the value chain, innovative manufacturing models—distributed small-scale local manufacturing, loosely coupled manufacturing ecosystems, and agile manufacturing—are arising to take advantage of these new opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, the boundary separating product makers from product sellers is increasingly permeable. Manufacturers are feeling the pressure—and gaining the ability—to increase both speed to market and customer engagement. And numerous factors are leading manufacturers to build to order rather than building to stock. In this environment, intermediaries that create value by holding inventory are becoming less and less necessary.\n\nTogether, these shifts have made it more difficult to create value in traditional ways. At the same time, as products become less objects of value in their own right and more the means for accessing information and experiences, creating and capturing value has moved from delivering physical objects to enabling that access.",

    "content": "Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological Association. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes.\n\nPsychology is really a very new science, with most advances happening over the past 150 years or so. However, its origins can be traced back to ancient Greece, 400 – 500 years BC. Philosophers used to discuss many topics now studied by modern psychology, such as memory, free will vs determinism, nature vs. nurture, attraction etc.\n\nIn the early days of psychology there were two dominant theoretical perspectives regarding how the brain worked, structuralism and functionalism. Structuralism was the name given to the approach pioneered by Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), which focused on breaking down mental processes intro the most basic components. The term originated from Edward Titchener, an American psychologist who had been trained by Wundt. Wundt was important because he separated psychology from philosophy by analyzing the workings of the mind in a more structured way, with the emphasis being on objective measurement and control. Structuralism relied on trained introspection, a research method whereby subjects related what was going on in their minds while performing a certain task.\n\nAn American psychologist named William James (1842-1910) developed an approach which came to be known as functionalism, that disagreed with the focus of Structuralism. James argued that the mind is constantly changing and it is pointless to look for the structure of conscious experience. Rather, he proposed the focus should be on how and why an organism does something, i.e. the functions or purpose of the brain. James suggested that psychologists should look for the underlying cause of behavior and the mental processes involved. This emphasis on the causes and consequences of behavior has influenced contemporary psychology.",

    "content": "Ecology is the study of interactions of organisms among themselves and with their environment. It seeks to understand patterns in nature (e.g., the spatial and temporal distribution of organisms) and the processes governing those patterns. Climatology is the study of the physical State or the atmosphere — its instantaneous State, or weather, its seasonal-to-inter annual variability, its long-term average condition or climate, and how changes over time. These two fields of scientific study are distinctly different. Ecology is a discipline within the biological sciences and has as its core the principle of natural selection. Climatology is a discipline within the geophysical sciences based applied physics and fluid dynamics. Both, however, share a common history.\n\nThe origin of these is attributed to the Greek scholars Aristotle and Theophrastus and their books meteorological and Enquiry into Plants, respectively, but their modern beginnings trace back to natural history and plant geography. Seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth century naturalists and geographers saw changes in vegetation as they explored new regions and laid the foundation for the development of ecology and climatology as they sought explanations for these geographic patterns. Alexander van Hurnboldt, in the early 1800s, observed that widely separated regions have structurally and functionally similar vegetation if their climate are similar. Alphonse de Candolle hypothesized that latitudinal zones of tropical, temperate, and arctic vegetation are caused by temperature and in 1874 proposed formal vegetation zones with associated temperature limits.",
    "answer": "Ecology is the study of organism-environment interactions, whereas climatology is the study about the physical state of the atmosphere, and these two disciplines share a common history because both their modern beginnings trace back to natural history and plant geography although the origin of these sciences is attributed to Greek scholars and their books.",

Inflation has been climbing in the United States at the highest rate in 40 years, up 9.1 percent over the past 12 months, much of it the result of spiking food and energy prices. The surge has been egged on by the pandemic-beleaguered supply chain and by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But climate change is becoming a driver of inflation, too. Experts are warning that heat, flooding, drought, wildfires and other disasters have been wreaking economic havoc, with worse to come.\n\n\"If we wish to control inflation, we must address climate change now,\" David A. Super, a professor of law and economics at Georgetown, wrote in The Hill. Beyond crops, the changing climate has driven up the price of lumber as well as insurance premiums.\n\n\"Heatflation\" might already have something to do with escalating food costs around the world. A heat wave in India this spring devastated wheat plants, leading it to ban exports. In the United States last year, searing heat and drought in the Great Plains scorched the wheat crop and also enabled wheat-munching grasshopper populations to flourish. The grain's price nearly doubled to $10.17 a bushel, its highest level since 2008. Extreme temperatures endanger livestock, too: The heat wave that struck much of the country in June caused thousands of cattle to die of heat stress in Kansas.",

    "content": "In its periodic quest for culinary identity, Australia automatically looks to its indigenous ingredients, the foods that are native to this country. ‘There can be little doubt that using an indigenous product must qualify a dish as Australian’, notes Stephanie Alexander. Similarly, and without qualification, Cherikoff states that ‘A uniquely Australian food culture can only be based upon foods indigenous to this country’, although, as Craw remarks, proposing Australian native foods as national symbols relies more upon their association with ‘nature’ and geographic origin than on common usage. Notwithstanding the lack of justification for the premise that national dishes are, of necessity, founded on ingredients native to the country—after all, Italy’s gastronomic identity is tied to the non-indigenous tomato, Thailand’s to the non-indigenous chili—the reality is that Australians do not eat indigenous foods in significant quantities. The exceptions are fish, crustaceans and shellfish from oceans, rivers and lakes, most of which are unarguably unique to this country. Despite valiant and well-intentioned efforts today at promoting and encouraging the consumption of native resources, bush foods are not harvested or produced in sufficient quantities for them to be a standard component of Australian diets, nor are they generally accessible. Indigenous foods are less relevant to Australian identity today than lamb and passionfruit, both initially imported and now naturalised.",

    "content": "Here’s how tree ring dating, known to scientists as dendrochronology (from the Greek roots dendron = tree, and chronos = time), works. If you cut a tree down today, it’s straightforward to count the rings inwards, starting from the tree’s outside (corresponding to this year’s growth ring), and thereby to state that the 177th ring from the ourtermost one towards the center was laid down in the year 2005 minus 177, or 1828. But it’s less straightforward to attach a date to a particular ring in an ancient Anasazi wooden beam, because at first you don’t know in what year the beam was cut. However, the widths of tree growth rings vary from year to year, depending on the rain or drought conditions in each year.\n\nHence the sequence of the rings in a tree cross-section is like a message in Morse code formerly used for sending telegraph messages; dot-dot-dash-dot-dash in the Morse code, wide-wide-narrow-wide-narrow in the tree ring sequence. Actually the tree ring sequence is even more diagnostic and richer in information than the Morse code, because trees actually contain rings spanning many different width, rather than the Morse code choice between dot or dash.\nTree ring specialists (known as dendrochronologists) proceed by noting the sequence of wider and narrower rings in a tree cut down in a known recent year, and also noting the sequences in beams from trees cut down at various times in the past. They then match up and align the tree ring sequences with the same diagnostic wide/narrow patterns from different beams.\n\nIn that way, dendrochronologists have constructed tree ring records extending back for thousands of years in some parts of the world. Each record is valid for a geographic area whose extent depends on local weather patterns, because weather and hence tree growth patterns vary with location. For instance, the basic tree ring chronology of the American Southwest applies (with some variation) to the area from Northern Mexico to Wyoming.\n\nA bonus of dendrochronology is that the width and substructure of each ring reflects the amount of rain and the season at which the rain fell during that particular year. Thus, tree ring studies also allow one to reconstruct the past climate, e.g., a series of wide rings means a very wet period, and a series of narrow rings means a drought. Tree rings thereby provide southwestern archaeologists with uniquely exact dating and uniquely detailed year to year environmental information.",
    "answer": "As the width and structure of tree rings reflect the rainfall volume of a particular year, dendrochronology is considered as diagnostic and it is well used by specialists to analyse ring sequences, which enables the reconstruction of the past climate and reveals detailed environmental information.",

    "content": "Most Americans know about Yellowstone National Park, the first national park in the U.S., which was established in 1872. Probably less well-known is the fact that Native American tribes were removed from the land to make the park possible.\n\nYellowstone is not an anomaly. Many Native American tribes once lived on sprawling ancestral lands that the U.S. government either forcibly took from them or purchased through treaties whose provisions were subsequently nullified. Some of this land later became part of the nation's 400-plus national parks and sites, with the U.S. government providing the historical interpretations. These interpretations, however, either downplayed or ignored the Indigenous point of view.\n\nCreating tribal national parks allows Indigenous people to be in charge of the narrative. Simply put, tribal national parks are national parks created on tribal lands. The first of these tribal national parks was Frog Bay Tribal National Park in Wisconsin, opened by the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in 2012. The park is on the state's Bayfield peninsula, across from the famous Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.\n\nSeveral more tribal national parks are in the works, as Indigenous people seek to preserve and protect their land, while creating recreational opportunities for their members and others, but there's another important reason for these parks' creation: They allow the tribes to tell their own stories.",

    "content": "According to the theory of continental drift, the world was made up of a single continent through most of geologic time. That continent eventually separated and drifted apart, forming into the seven continents we have today. The first comprehensive theory of continental drift was suggested by the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener in 1912. The hypothesis asserts that the continents consist of lighter rocks that rest on heavier crustal material—similar to the manner in which icebergs float on water. Wegener contended that the relative positions of the continents are not rigidly fixed but are slowly moving—at a rate of about one yard per century.\n\nAccording to the generally accepted plate-tectonics theory, scientists believe that Earth's surface is broken into a number of shifting slabs or plates, which average about 50 miles in thickness. These plates move relative to one another above a hotter, deeper, more mobile zone at average rates as great as a few inches per year. Most of the world's active volcanoes are located along or near the boundaries between shifting plates and are called plate-boundary volcanoes.\n\nThe peripheral areas of the Pacific Ocean Basin, containing the boundaries of several plates, are dotted with many active volcanoes that form the so-called Ring of Fire. The Ring provides excellent examples of plate-boundary volcanoes, including Mount St. Helens.\n\nHowever, some active volcanoes are not associated with plate boundaries, and many of these so-called intra-plate volcanoes form roughly linear chains in the interior of some oceanic plates. The Hawaiian Islands provide perhaps the best example of an intra-plate volcanic chain, developed by the northwest-moving Pacific plate passing over an inferred “hot spot” that initiates the magma-generation and volcano-formation process.",
    "answer": "Surface of the Earth is split into multiple slow moving tectonic plates where the boundaries between shifting plates host not only most of the active plate-boundary volcanoes around Pacific Ocean Basin, but also non-boundary volcanoes including intra-plate volcanoes that formed linear chains in the interior of numerous oceanic plates.",

These wins have also sparked a debate as to whether beauty pageants are just harmless reminders of old- fashioned values or a throwback to the days when women were respected for how good they looked.\n\nOpponents argue that beauty pageants, whether its Miss Universe or Miss Teen International, are demeaning to women and out of sync with the times. They say they are nothing more than symbols of decline.\n\nIn the past few decades Australia has taken more than a few faltering steps toward treating women with dignity and respect. Young women are being brought up knowing that they can do anything, as shown by inspiring role models in medicine such as 2003 Australian of the Year Professor Fiona Stanley.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, one of the first acts of the feminist movement was to picket beauty pageants on the premise that the industry promoted the view that it was acceptable to judge women on their appearance. Today many young Australian women are still profoundly uncomfortable with their body image, feeling under all kinds of pressures because they are judged by how they look.\n\nAlmost all of the pageant victors are wafer thin, reinforcing the message that thin equals beautiful. This ignores the fact that men and women come in all sizes and shapes. In a country where up to 60% of young women are on a diet at any one time and 70 % of school girls say they want to lose weight, despite the fact that most have a normal BMI, such messages are profoundly hazardous to the mental health of young Australians.",

    "content": "UCLA neurology professor Paul Thompson and colleagues scanned the brains of 23 sets of identical twins and 23 sets of fraternal twins. Since identical twins share the same genes while fraternal twins share about half their genes, the researchers were able to compare each group to show that myelin integrity was determined genetically in many parts of the brain that are key for intelligence. These include the parietal lobes, which are responsible for spatial reasoning, visual processing and logic, and the corpus callosum, which pulls together information from both sides of the body.\n\nThe researchers used a faster version of a type of scanner called a HARDI (high-angular resolution diffusion imaging) — think of an MRI machine on steroids — that takes scans of the brain at a much higher resolution than a standard MRI. While an MRI scan shows the volume of different tissues in the brain by measuring the amount of water present, HARDI tracks how water diffuses through the brain's white matter — a way to measure the quality of its myelin.\n\n\"HARDI measures water diffusion,\" said Thompson, who is also a member of the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro-Imaging. \"If the water diffuses rapidly in a specific direction, it tells us that the brain has very fast connections. If it diffuses more broadly, that's an indication of slower signaling, and lower intelligence.\"",
    "answer": "By using HARDI, a scanner that not only shows water content but also myelin quality through water diffusion of brain tissues of identical and fraternal twins, researchers were able to perform comparative analysis on different brain parts to track water diffusion behaviour and determine brain’s connection speed, an indicator of intelligence level.",

    "content": "Scientists believe they may have found a way to prevent complications that can arise following cataract surgery, the world’s leading cause of blindness.\n\nDetailing why complications can occur after surgery, researchers from the University of East Anglia (UEA) explained that while cataract surgery works well to restore vision, a few natural lens cells always remain after the procedure. Over time, the eye’s wound-healing response leads these cells to spread across the underside of the artificial lens, which interferes with vision, causing what’s known as ‘posterior capsule opacification’ or secondary cataract.\n\nUEA’s School of Biological Sciences academic, Dr Michael Wormstone, who led the study, said: “Secondary visual loss responds well to treatment with laser surgery. But as life expectancy increases, the problems of cataract and posterior capsule opacification will become even greater in terms of both patient well being and economic burden. It’s essential that we find better ways to manage the condition in future.”\n\nAs a result, researchers are designing new artificial lenses that can be placed into a capsular bag that stays open, instead of shrink-wrapping closed, which currently occurs. It is believed that, through the new approach, fluid in the eye can flow around the artificial lens, therefore diluting and washing away the cell-signalling molecules that encourage cell re-growth.",

But what is really astonishing is that the clock was designed more than 250 years ago by a man who was derided at the time for “an incoherence and absurdity that was little short of the symptoms of insanity”, and whose plans for the clock lay ignored for two centuries.\n\nThe derision was poured on John Harrison, the British clockmaker whose marine chronometers had revolutionised seafaring in the 18th century (and who was the subject of Longitude by Dava Sobel). His subsequent claim – that he would go on to make a pendulum timepiece that was accurate to within a second over a 100-day period – triggered widespread ridicule. The task was simply impossible, it was declared.\n\nBut now the last laugh lies with Harrison. At a conference, Harrison Decoded: Towards a Perfect Pendulum Clock, held at Greenwich yesterday, observatory scientists revealed that a clock that had been built to the clockmaker’s exact specifications had run for 100 days during official tests and had lost only five-eighths of a second in that period.",

    "content": "Jonas Salk's legacy as the developer of the polio vaccine marks a monumental milestone in medical history. Born in 1914 in New York City, Salk's journey in medicine was driven by a deep-seated desire to alleviate human suffering. His work revolutionized the field of virology and transformed public health.\n\nSalk's early career was marked by his interest in influenza, leading him to develop techniques for vaccine creation. However, his focus shifted to the poliovirus in the 1940s, a time when polio epidemics were a source of widespread fear, primarily affecting children. Salk embarked on a mission to develop a vaccine, working tirelessly at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 1955, after years of research and clinical trials, Salk's polio vaccine was declared safe and effective. It was a moment of global celebration. The vaccine not only offered protection against the crippling disease but also represented hope and progress in medical science. Salk's refusal to patent the vaccine, making it freely available, demonstrated his commitment to humanity over personal gain.\n\nSalk's contribution went beyond polio. He founded the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 1963, fostering scientific research and innovation. His vision was for a collaborative environment where researchers could explore the complexities of life and disease.\n\nDespite his achievements, Salk remained humble, often saying, \"The reward for work well done is the opportunity to do more.\" He passed away in 1995, leaving behind a legacy of compassion, dedication, and groundbreaking medical advancements.",

    "content": "You may have heard about global warming. It seems that in the last 100 years the earth's temperature has increased about half a degree Celsius. This may not sound like much, but even half a degree can have an effect on our planet. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the sea level has risen 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) in the last 100 years.\n\nThis higher temperature may be causing some floating icebergs to melt, but this will not make the oceans rise. Icebergs are large floating chunks of ice. In order to float, the iceberg displaces a volume of water that has a weight equal to that of the iceberg. Submarines use this principle to rise and sink in the water, too.\n\nHowever, the rising temperature and icebergs could play a small role in the rising ocean level. Icebergs are chunks of frozen glaciers that break off from landmasses and fall into the ocean. The rising temperature may be causing more icebergs to form by weakening the glaciers, causing more cracks and making ice more likely to break off. As soon as the ice falls into the ocean, the ocean rises a little.\n\nIf the rising temperature affects glaciers and icebergs, could the polar ice caps be in danger of melting and causing the oceans to rise? This could happen, but no one knows when it might happen.",
    "answer": "A half-degree increase in the Earth's temperature over the last century has led to a rise of 6 to 8 inches in sea levels, with icebergs potentially contributing to this elevation as they break off from glaciers and weaken due to rising temperatures, although the future impact on polar ice caps remains uncertain.",

    "content": "According to the United States Constitution, a Presidential election is to be held once every fourth year. The process of electing a President and Vice-President begins long before Election Day. Candidates from both major and minor political parties and independent candidates begin to raise money and campaign well in advance of the general presidential election. In order to officially represent a political party, a candidate must be nominated by that party.\n\nThis primary nomination process is a contest that often produces factions within political parties. These divisions impact the policy stances and agendas of the candidates running for nomination as they attempt to garner the support of party leaders and activists. The nominating process officially begins with the first state primaries and caucuses, which usually occur in the month of February of the election year. It is at these local events that voters are given their first chance to participate in electing the nation’s next President.\n\nThere are many factors that influence who will ultimately become the candidate for a party. The public’s perception of the candidates is influenced by such things as media reports, public opinion polls, candidate preference surveys, and advertising. These factors will help determine the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the candidates in the months leading up to the caucuses and primaries.",

With the changes, the company will be able to test hydrogen-powered flight in real-world conditions.  \n\nThe move is part of a broader industry goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  Passenger air travel is a growing contributor to climate change, making up about three percent of carbon emissions worldwide in 2021. While flying less and investing in more efficient planes can help reduce emissions, new technologies will likely be needed to reach net zero.\n\nOther solutions, like battery-powered air taxis and sustainable aviation fuels, may help cut emissions, but hydrogen in particular might be one of the major paths forward to net zero because it could be used widely in the industry, from shorter regional hops to longer flights with larger planes.\n\nUnderstanding emissions from hydrogen combustion in real-air conditions is one of the major goals of this testing program, Simpson says. While burning liquid hydrogen doesn’t produce CO2, the most abundant greenhouse gas, researchers are still eager to learn more about emissions from hydrogen-powered flight. Hydrogen engines will still produce some nitrous oxides, which are common pollutants, as well as water vapor, which acts as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.\n\nThe test engine will also allow Airbus to learn more about how best to run hydrogen combustion in flight. Researchers can change the operating conditions of the engine, like the fuel-to-air ratio it burns, and the temperature it runs at, to learn more about how to most efficiently power a hydrogen-powered plane.",

Recent research has highlighted the significance of this indigenous wisdom in promoting sustainable practices and preserving the environment.\n\nThe Navajo people have inhabited the southwestern United States for centuries and have developed a deep understanding of their natural surroundings. This knowledge encompasses sustainable land management, water conservation, and the utilization of native plants for medicinal and cultural purposes.\n\nIn recent years, the Navajo Nation has faced environmental challenges, including droughts and the impacts of climate change. The tribe's traditional ecological knowledge has become an invaluable resource in responding to these challenges. For instance, the Navajo people's historical practices of water harvesting and efficient crop cultivation have been adapted to mitigate the effects of prolonged droughts.\n\nFurthermore, the Navajo Nation's emphasis on the use of native plants in traditional ceremonies and healing practices aligns with modern efforts to protect biodiversity and promote the use of indigenous flora in sustainable agriculture and medicine.\n\nIncorporating traditional ecological knowledge into contemporary environmental initiatives not only benefits the Navajo people but also contributes to broader conservation efforts. It showcases the importance of indigenous perspectives in tackling complex environmental issues and reinforces the idea that cultural heritage and sustainable environmental practices can go hand in hand.\n\nIn conclusion, the traditional ecological knowledge of the Navajo Nation serves as a model for the integration of indigenous wisdom into modern environmental conservation efforts.

Unfortunately, governments know this, too — so the process of legally changing your name often involves red tape, loads of paperwork, and high fees.\n\nName change laws vary from one U.S. state to the next, so navigating that maze of rules, forms, and hearings can be overwhelming. While a legal name change can be a bureaucratic nightmare, it's necessary for people who wish to make their new names official.\n\nSome people decide to change their names for unconventional reasons, too, like they want the same name as their favorite superhero. Generally, you're allowed to choose an unusual name for an atypical reason. But some names are off limits in certain states, like names that are vulgar or offensive, ones that may cause harm or public confusion, and ones that have excessive or numerical characters.\n\nBecause individual states handle name changes, it is impossible to provide a one-size-fits-all guide to the process. Though you'd need to refer to the instructions supplied by your local court or consult with an attorney to learn the rules specific to your situation, there are guidelines that are common across the U.S.\n\nLegal name changes can be divided into two basic categories: those that require you to file a petition with a local court and those that don't. We'll start with the latter, since those can demand less up-front legwork. These kinds of name changes occur within other legal proceedings, such as marriage, divorce, and naturalization.",

    "content": "The notion that office space has a role in promoting or inhibiting performance is backed up by solid research. A recent study conducted by Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that improvements to the physical surroundings of workers impacted on productivity – not just because the working environment was more attractive, but because the changes made employees feel cared for. A Swedish research paper revealed a strong link between the type of office an employee worked in and their overall job satisfaction and health.\n\nVarious findings have emerged as a result of studies such as this. Pot plants and greenery can apparently have a real impact on psychological well-being. Those who work in a private room tend to be in better health than workers based in open-plan offices. Sufficient light can reduce sickness among workers and increase productivity; and an attractive office can make workers feel more cared for and therefore more loyal to their company.\n\nMost of these points make good rational sense. But some companies aren’t content simply to increase the health, productivity and contentment of their employees. Pioneers such as Google, Walt Disney and Dyson have tried to create offices that will do everything from promoting collaboration between workers to stimulating their creative juices.\n\n“Environment, both physical and cultural, can make or break creativity,” says Kursty Groves, author of I Wish I Worked There! A Look Inside the Most Creative Spaces in Business. “Stimulating spaces expose the mind to a variety of stimuli – planned or random – in order to encourage people to think differently. Reflective spaces promote the filtering of information into the brain, slowing it to make connections. An environment which encourages a team to build trust and to play freely is an essential ingredient for innovation.”",

    "content": "Broadly speaking, there are two different ways of thinking about modern art, or two different versions of the story. One way is to view art as something that can be practised (and thought of) as an activity radically separate from everyday life or worldly concerns. From this point of view, art is said to be ‘autonomous’ from society – that is, it is believed to be self-sustaining and self-referring. One particularly influential version of this story suggests that modern art should be viewed as a process by which features extraneous to a particular branch of art would be progressively eliminated, and painters or sculptors would come to concentrate on problems specific to their domain. Another way of thinking about modern art is to view it as responding to the modern world, and to see modern artists immersing themselves in the conflicts and challenges of society. That is to say, some modern artists sought ways of conveying the changing experiences generated in Europe by the twin processes of commercialisation (the commodification of everyday life) and urbanisation. From this point of view, modern art is a way of reflecting on the transformations that created what we call, in a sort of shorthand, ‘modernity’.",

Paying children to do extra work around the house, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience the things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save and maybe even invest it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children and teenagers learn about personal finance. A savings account is an excellent way to learn about the power of compound interest. Interest rates on savings can be very low these days. But compounding works by paying interest on interest. So, for example, one dollar invested at two percent interest will earn two cents in the first year. The second year, the money will earn two percent of one dollar and two cents, and so on. That may not seem like a lot. But over time it adds up.",

And the Moon is mostly made of the same rocks you’ll find on Earth (although with a slightly greater amount of material that came from meteors). Minerals such as silica, aluminium, and iron and magnesium oxides dominate the Moon’s landscape. All of these minerals contain oxygen, but not in a form our lungs can access.\n\nThe Moon’s regolith is made up of approximately 45% oxygen. But that oxygen is tightly bound into the minerals mentioned above. In order to break apart those strong bonds, we need to put in energy. You might be familiar with this if you know about electrolysis. On Earth this process is commonly used in manufacturing, such as to produce aluminium. An electrical current is passed through a liquid form of aluminium oxide (commonly called alumina) via electrodes, to separate the aluminium from the oxygen. In this case, the oxygen is produced as a byproduct. On the Moon, the oxygen would be the main product and the aluminium (or other metal) extracted would be a potentially useful byproduct. It’s a pretty straightforward process, but there is a catch: it’s very energy hungry. To be sustainable, it would need to be supported by solar energy or other energy sources available on the Moon.\n\nExtracting oxygen from regolith would also require substantial industrial equipment. We’d need to first convert solid metal oxide into liquid form, either by applying heat, or heat combined with solvents or electrolytes. We have the technology to do this on Earth, but moving this apparatus to the Moon – and generating enough energy to run it – will be a mighty challenge. ",

Pink or brown noise may be even more helpful at blocking out unwanted sounds and getting you better sleep. It's the sound inconsistency (noises going from loud to soft or vice versa) rather than the sound level that tends to wake you up. White noise creates a blanket of sounds that masks this inconsistency. White noise is made up of sounds from all over the spectrum, from low-frequency bass notes to high-frequency chimes. These sounds are all blended together to create a constant stream of soft noise. White noises occurring in nature include sprinkling rain, gently running water and a breeze sifting through trees, all sounds that humans tend to find relaxing at any time of day. Pink noise is similar to white noise, but it leans less heavily on high frequencies and more on bass and mid-range tones, so it sounds like moderate rainfall or ocean waves. Those who dislike higher-pitched sounds may find pink noise more pleasing to the ear. Brown noise emphasizes bass notes even further, almost completely eliminating high frequencies from its profile. Natural brown noises can be things like roaring river rapids, heavy rainfall and distant rumbling thunder. This type of noise is named not only for a color, but also for Scottish scientist Robert Brown. In the 1800s, Brown observed pollen particles moving randomly in water and devised a mathematical formula to predict these movements. When this randomizing formula is used to generate electronic sound, a bass-heavy noise profile results. Brown noise is sometimes known as red noise.",

    "content": "A plunging oil price has dragged UK inflation to zero over recent months. But analysts say the fall in retail prices cannot solely be attributed to oil.\n\nDiscount retailers continue to steal market share from established industry giants, taking an increased chunk of both food and non-food markets. And, as retail analyst Nick Bubb notes, “the big supermarkets have had to respond to this by bringing down their own ‘rip off’ prices”. The result is a sector-wide fall in prices paid at the till.\n\nThe growth of online retailers has also brought prices down, in part due to the ease with which customers can compare prices and purchase goods elsewhere if they find an item cheaper on a competitor’s site. Retailers are also reluctant to offer different prices in their physical and online stores, according to retail analyst Richard Hyman, which means shops are forced to cut prices on the high street.\n\nAn ever-expanding range of shops is also to blame, according to Mr. Hyman. “Overcapacity is the biggest of the issues affecting prices,” he says. “In the last 10 years, online alone has added the equivalent of 110m square feet of trading space — that’s roughly equal to 65 additional Westfield London shopping malls. An increase in supply of retailers, with no increase in demand, has left the industry massively oversupplied.”",
    "answer": "Plummeting oil price is only partially blamed for the overall retail price drop, and the underlying cause is that both increased market share for discount retailers and upsurges of online retailers that oversupplied the retail industry have not only led to traditional retailer price adjustment, but also cross-the-board pricing competition.",

    "content": "Pets, particularly cats and dogs, have long held a special place in the hearts of humans. Their companionship, loyalty, and ability to bring joy into our lives make them cherished members of our families. Cats, known for their independent nature, offer a sense of calm and tranquility. Their purring can be soothing, and their playful antics can brighten even the dullest of days. Cats require relatively low maintenance and are well-suited for people with busy lifestyles. On the other hand, dogs are known for their boundless enthusiasm and loyalty. They thrive on human interaction and make excellent companions for those who enjoy outdoor activities. Dogs provide not only companionship but also a sense of security, as they often form strong protective bonds with their owners. The benefits of pet ownership extend beyond companionship. Studies have shown that having a cat or dog can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. The simple act of petting an animal can release endorphins and promote a sense of well-being. Moreover, pets teach responsibility and empathy, especially in children. Caring for a pet instills a sense of commitment and compassion, as individuals must meet their pet's needs and provide love and attention. However, pet ownership also comes with responsibilities. Proper care, including feeding, grooming, and regular veterinary visits, is essential for the well-being of these furry friends. Additionally, it's crucial to consider the time, space, and resources required to provide a happy and healthy life for your pet. In conclusion, cats and dogs bring immeasurable joy and comfort to our lives. They offer companionship, reduce stress, and teach important life lessons. Owning a pet is a rewarding experience that can enrich our lives in countless ways, making them beloved members of our families.",

    "content": "Four years ago, Darek Fidyka was stabbed in the back, leaving his spinal cord severed, and his body from the chest down paralyzed. Now, after an experimental treatment, Fidyka has regained some feeling in his lower body and is learning to walk again.\n\nThe researchers are looking to use less invasive techniques in the future, because undergoing brain surgery to extract the olfactory tissue isn't anyone's idea of a good time, much less someone who is paralyzed.\n\nThe BBC reports that over 100 micro injections of olfactory ensheathing cells were injected into the injury site, and strips of nerve tissue from Fidyka's ankle were laid across the gap in the spinal cord, in the hopes that the cells from the olfactory bulbs would encourage regrowth. A similar procedure had been sucessfully tested on dogs in 2012.\nNow, 19 months after the operation, Fidyka has regained sensation in parts of his lower body, and after intense physical therapy is able to walk using a walker. As an added bonus, even with one olfactory bulb removed, Fidyka retained his sense of smell.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"I think it's realistic that one day I will become independent. What I have learned is that you must never give up but keep fighting, because some door will open in life.\"\n\nThe story is the subject of an episode of the BBC television program Panorama airing today at 10:35 pm in the UK. The study itself will be published in the journal Cell Transplantation at a later date, but the researchers acknowledge that as exciting as this result is, there is still a lot more work to be done.\n\n\"Our results are very encouraging,\" the medical team is quoted as saying in a statement. \"However, our results need to be confirmed in a larger group of patients with a similar injury. In the meantime, we are investigating surgical techniques for more minimally invasive access to the olfactory bulb.\"",

    "content": "The central nervous system controls most functions of the body and mind. It consists of two parts: the brain and the spinal cord. The brain is the center of our thoughts, the interpreter of our external environment, and the origin of control over body movement. The spinal cord is the highway for communication between the body and the brain. When the spinal cord is injured, the exchange of information between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted.\n\nMost systems and organs of the body control just one function, but the central nervous system does many jobs at the same time. It controls all voluntary movement, such as speech and walking, and involuntary movements, such as blinking and breathing. It is also the core of our thoughts, perceptions, and emotions.\n\nThe central nervous system is better protected than any other system or organ in the body. Its main line of defense is the bones of the skull and spinal column, which create a hard physical barrier to injury. A fluid-filled space below the bones, called the syrnix, provides shock absorbance.\n\nUnfortunately, this protection can be a double-edged sword. When an injury to the central nervous system occurs, the soft tissue of the brain and spinal cord swells, causing pressure because of the confined space. The swelling makes the injury worse unless it is rapidly relieved. Fractured bones can lead to further damage and the possibility of infection.",

    "content": "Autism is a disorder characterized by impairments in communication, social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. Over the past 40 years, the measured prevalence of autism has multiplied roughly 10-fold. While progress has been made in understanding some of the factors associated with increased risk and rising prevalence, no one knows with certainty what causes autism or what caused autism prevalence to rise so precipitously. There is, however, a growing awareness among scholars that focusing solely on individual risk factors such as exposure toxicants, prenatal complications, or parental education is insufficient to explain why autism prevalence rates have increased so stunningly. Social and institutional processes likely play an important role. For example, changes in diagnostic criteria and an influx of resources dedicated to autism diagnosis may be critical to understanding why prevalence rates have risen. Increased awareness and social influence have been implicated in the rise of autism and a variety of comparable disorders, where social processes mimic the effects of contagion. Studies have examined the contribution of changes in diagnostic criteria and diagnostic substitution to rising autism prevalence rates, but the importance of institutional factors, resources for diagnosis, and greater awareness have not been systematically assessed. The sociological literature on health and inequality, however, provides substantial motivation for exploring how individual- and community-level effects operate to shape the likelihood of an autism diagnosis.",

    "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic created an enormous level of stress on a global scale, leading to elevated levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses. Along with this, was a disruption and challenges in the delivery of mental health services that were traditionally provided in the office. This disruption, increasing need, and the already limited access to mental health services, especially in underserved areas, could create a very challenging situation. To prevent that, we had to make a robust transition in our ways of delivering services to videoconferencing and allowing coverage by the payors.\n\nLike other transitions, adopting the use of technology was challenging for many, especially in the absence of high-speed internet infrastructure for some patients. For those with limited logistics or knowledge of video-conferencing, often the sessions take place over the phone, which reduces access to a patient’s nonverbal behavior. Sound quality might not be great, leading to extended time for enabling sufficient communication. Although in psychiatry physical examination is used less often than in most other medical specialties, when it is needed, telepsychiatry is a barrier.\n\nDespite these challenges, telepsychiatry has provided enormous opportunities, especially for less economically privileged patients. For an office visit, one must take time off work, find child support, and have access to reliable transportation to make it to the visit. For those with limited resources, or in areas far from psychiatric services, this would lead to frequent interruptions in care and economic cost. Telepsychiatry has overcome those barriers. Patients can connect to providers regardless of their geographical location, and connect while at home near their children, during their lunch break, or even from their car in the parking lot.",

This incredible natural phenomenon is not only a marvel to behold but also serves various functions in the animal kingdom.\n\nOne of the most well-known bioluminescent creatures is the firefly. These tiny insects produce light through a chemical reaction in their abdomen to attract mates during their nocturnal courtship displays. Fireflies create a mesmerizing spectacle on warm summer evenings, as they flicker and glow in synchrony.\n\nDeep beneath the ocean's surface, bioluminescence is even more prevalent. Many marine species, including certain types of jellyfish, anglerfish, and plankton, use bioluminescence for a range of purposes. Some deep-sea creatures employ it as a form of camouflage, matching their light emission to the faint glow of sunlight filtering through the water above.\n\nBioluminescence can also be a means of communication and defence. Some squids use flashes of light to communicate with each other or to deter predators. The ability to emit sudden bursts of bluish light can startle and confuse potential threats, allowing the squid to escape.\n\nScientists have been studying bioluminescent animals for years, not only to understand the biological mechanisms behind their light production but also to develop new technologies. The enzymes and molecules responsible for bioluminescence have been utilized in biotechnology, leading to advancements in fields like medicine and genetics.\n\nIn summary, the world of bioluminescent animals is a captivating realm filled with unique and awe-inspiring creatures. These organisms have evolved remarkable adaptations, from finding mates to surviving in the depths of the ocean. Beyond their natural beauty, they offer valuable insights and potential applications that continue to inspire scientific research and innovation.",

    "content": "The face, though better preserved than most of the statue, has been battered by centuries of weathering and vandalism. In 1402, an Arab historian reported that a Sufi zealot had disfigured it “to remedy some religious errors.” Yet there are clues to what the face looked like in its prime. Archaeological excavations in the early 19th century found pieces of its carved stone beard and a royal cobra emblem from its headdress. Residues of red pigment are still visible on the face, leading researchers to conclude that at some point, the Sphinx’s entire visage was painted red. Traces of blue and yellow paint elsewhere suggest to Lehner that the Sphinx was once decked out in gaudy comic book colors.\n\nFor thousands of years, sand buried the colossus up to its shoulders, creating a vast disembodied head atop the eastern edge of the Sahara. Then, in 1817, a Genoese adventurer, Capt. Giovanni Battista Caviglia, led 160 men in the first modern attempt to dig out the Sphinx. They could not hold back the sand, which poured into their excavation pits nearly as fast as they could dig it out. The Egyptian archaeologist Selim Hassan finally freed the statue from the sand in the late 1930s. “The Sphinx has thus emerged into the landscape out of shadows of what seemed to be an impenetrable oblivion,” the New York Times declared.",

    "content": "To understand the final reason why the news marketplace of ideas dominated by television is so different form the one that emerged in the world dominated by the printing press, it is important to distinguish the quality of vividness experienced by television viewers from the “vividness” experienced by readers. I believe that the vividness experienced in the reading of words is automatically modulated by the constant activation of the reasoning centres of the brain that are used in the process of co-creating the representation of reality the author has intended. By contrast, the visceral vividness portrayed on television has the capacity to trigger instinctual responses similar to those triggered by reality itself – and without being modulated by logic, reason, and reflective thought.\n\nThe simulation of reality accomplished in the television medium is so astonishingly vivid and compelling compared with the representations of reality conveyed by printed words that it signifies much more than an incremental change in the way people consume information. Books also convey compelling and vivid representation of reality, of course. But the reader actively participates in the conjuring of the reality the book’s author is attempting to depict. Moreover, the parts of the human brain that are central to the reasoning process are continually activated by the very act of reading printed words: Words are composed of abstract symbols – letters – that have no intrinsic meaning themselves until they are strung together into recognisable sequences.\n\nTelevision, by contrast, present to its viewers a much more fully formed representation of reality – without requiring the creative collaboration that words have always demanded.",
    "answer": "News marketplace ideas between television and print are strikingly different because unlike reading words which is basically a collection of abstract symbols that requires the activation of brain’s reasoning process to co-create the representation of experience, the vivid experience constructed by television directly triggers instinctual response and bypasses the creative collaboration of the brain activity.",

    "content": "When an individual drives a car, heats a house, or uses an aerosol hair spray, greenhouse gases are produced. In economic terms, this creates a classic negative externality. Most of the cost (in this case, those arising from global warming) are borne by individuals other than the one making the decision about how many miles to drive or how much hair spray to use. Because the driver (or sprayer) enjoys all the benefits of the activities but suffers only part of the cost, that individual engages in more than the economically efficient amount of the activity. In this sense, the problem of greenhouse gases parallels the problem that occurs when someone smokes a cigarette in an enclosed space or litters the countryside with fast-food wrappers. If we are to get individuals to reduce production of greenhouse gases to the efficient rate, we must somehow induce them to act as though they bear all the costs of their actions. The two most widely accepted means of doing this are government regulation and taxation, both of which have been proposed to deal with greenhouse gases.",

Time is also an important factor in architecture, since a building is usually comprehended in a succession of experiences rather than all at once. In most architecture there is no one vantage point from which the whole structure can be understood. The use of light and shadow, as well as surface decoration, can greatly enhance a structure.\n\nThe analysis of building types provides an insight into past cultures and eras. Behind each of the greater styles lies not a casual trend nor a vogue, but a period of serious and urgent experimentation directed toward answering the needs of a specific way of life. Climate, methods of labour, available materials, and economy of means all impose their dictates. Each of the greater styles has been aided by the discovery of new construction methods. Once developed, a method survives tenaciously, giving way only when social changes or new building techniques have reduced it. That evolutionary process is exemplified by the history of modern architecture, which developed from the first uses of structural iron and steel in the mid-19th cent.",

Most often, the smells are unpleasant, like hand soap smelling like dead bodies and the outdoors like sewage. This odd distortion of scent is being seen in a growing number of people who have contracted COVID-19, lost their sense of smell and taste, and recovered from the virus but never fully regained their sense of smell again, says Dr. Jennifer Grayson, director of otolaryngology research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"Parosmia is not classified as a long-haul symptom of COVID. It's more of a complicating and potentially permanent factor of COVID,\" she says. Parosmia is closely related to phantosmia, an olfactory hallucination characterized by smelling something that isn't there, such as smelling smoke when there's nothing burning, Grayson says. It can also be intertwined with a distorted sense of taste known as dysgeusia. For example, a member of a Parosmia/Post-COVID Facebook group described toothpaste tasting like \"how a landfill smells.\" These odd odors and tastes are described by other Facebook group members as \"dumpster juice,\" \"hot garbage,\" \"potting soil,\" \"rotting flesh\" and \"dog.\" They can greatly diminish quality of life. Eating becomes excruciating difficult, as most things that tasted pleasant before they developed parosmia suddenly cause sufferers to gag or vomit. Because parosmia can linger for months, many of these individuals lose weight and some become depressed and hopeless for fear they will never regain their sense of smell and taste.",

Moreover, the activities which led to the creation of these anthropogenic soils were largely disrupted after the European conquest.\n\nEncouragingly researchers in the West Africa study were able to live within communities as they created their fertile soils. This enabled them to learn the techniques used by the women from the indigenous communities who disposed of ash, bones and other organic waste to create the African Dark Earths.",

Working from home in isolation can also prevent people from engaging in the daily interpersonal relationships that working life can offer – and which can help creativity and improve our mental wellbeing.\n\nTime is our most precious commodity and a currency to spend. As my own research on lateness has highlighted, time management involves managing complex relationships and conflicts within ourselves – as well as with others.\n\nBut when working from home, temptations abound which can eat up our time. Food is in the fridge or can be bought in a quick trip to the shops. Excitement of all kinds can be easily accessed through social media, websites or games which will arouse, enrage, shock, entertain, amuse or enthral us. For some, the temptations to use their time “badly”, particularly online, can be very seductive.

    "content": "Banks provide short-term ﬁnance to companies in the form of an overdraft on a current account. The advantage of an overdraft is its ﬂexibility. When the cash needs of the company increase with seasonal factors, the company can continue to write cheques and watch the overdraft increase. When the goods and services are sold and cash begins to ﬂow in, the company should be able to watch the overdraft decrease again. The most obvious example of a business which operates in this pattern is farming. The farmer uses the overdraft to ﬁnance the acquisition of seed for arable farming, or feed through the winter for stock farming and to cover the period when the crops or animals are growing and maturing. The overdraft is reduced when the crops or the animals are sold.\n\nThe main disadvantage of an overdraft is that it is repayable on demand. The farmer whose crop fails because of bad weather knows the problem of being unable to repay the overdraft. Having overdraft ﬁnancing increases the worries of those who manage the company. The other disadvantage is that the interest payable on overdrafts is variable. When interest rates increase, the cost of the overdraft increases. Furthermore, for small companies there are often complaints that the rate of interest charged is high compared with that available to larger companies. The banks answer that the rates charged reﬂect relative risk and it is their experience that small companies are more risky.",

    "content": "Although succulents can vary greatly in appearance, they share a number of basic fundamental characteristics. The most important of these is the succulent's ability to store water, from which its name is derived. Plants all have a certain degree of succulence. But succulents took this talent to new heights: some can store years' worth of water in either their stems, roots or leaves for times of severe drought. Think of the wide stem of a saguaro cactus or the thick fleshy leaves of an aloe plant, and you're basically looking at an expandable botanical rain barrel.\n\nHow are they going to collect any water in all those wild environments they inhabit? Many succulents have fantastic root systems completely specialized for their environments. In mountain regions, roots often dig down deep to harvest any subterranean water sources. But up on the plains, their roots are often broadly spread but incredibly shallow in order to catch any moisture that might lick the surface of the land, such as morning dew.\n\nPlants wage a constant battle to get all the nutrients they need in order to function. Besides water, they also need sunlight and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The CO2 comes in through diffusion so most plants have a huge number of pores, called stomata, to coax it in. But at the same time the sun is providing them with the energy they need to perform photosynthesis, it's also evaporating water (a process that in plants is called transpiration) through the exposed stomata. It's a difficult tightrope to walk, so succulents have managed to get themselves a safety harness.",

For similar reasons, the United States will specialize in the production of goods that are human-and-physical-capital intensive because of the relative abundance of a highly educated labor force and technically sophisticated equipment in the United States.\n\nThis division of global production should yield higher global output of both types of goods than would be the case if each country attempted to produce both of these goods itself. For example, the United States would produce more expensive labor-intensive goods because of its more expensive labor and the developing countries would produce more expensive human and physical capital-intensive goods because of their relative scarcity of these inputs. This logic implies that the United States is unlikely to be a significant global competitor in the production green technologies that are not relatively intensive in human and physical capital.\n\nNevertheless, during the early stages of the development of a new technology, the United States has a comparative advantage in the production of the products enabled by this innovation. However, once these technologies become well understood and production processes are designed that can make use of less skilled labor, production will migrate to countries with less expensive labor.",

Identical torches must be manufactured for each runner in the relay before the initial lighting of the Olympic flame in Greece. The entire process of designing, modeling, prototyping, testing, and manufacturing actually begins years before the games themselves begin.\n\nThe fundamental elements of an Olympic torch are simple.

Beyond that, the unique design for a particular host city is left up to the organizing committee. \n\nEach torch is designed with the host country in mind. In the case of the Tokyo 2020 torch, designer Tokujin Yoshioka was inspired by the traditional flower of Japan, which is the cherry blossom.

Seen in this light, museology might appear at first sight a subject so specialized as to concern only museum professionals, who by virtue of their occupation are more or less obliged to take an interest in it. In reality, since museums are almost, if not quite as old as civilization itself, and since the plethora of present-day museums embraces virtually every field of human endeavor not just art, or craft, or science, but entertainment, agriculture, rural life, childhood, fisheries, antiquities, automobiles: the list is endless – it is a field of enquiry so broad as to be a matter of concern to almost everybody.",

For the grasses, which have evolved to withstand the grazing of ruminants, the cow maintains and expands their habitat by preventing trees and shrubs from gaining a foothold and hogging the sunlight; the animal also spreads grass seed, plants it with his hooves, and then fertilizes it with his manure. In exchange for these services the grasses offer ruminants a plentiful and exclusive supply of lunch. For cows (like sheep, bison, and other ruminants) have evolved the special ability to convert grass which single-stomached creatures like us can't digest into high-quality protein. They can do this because they possess what is surely the most highly evolved digestive organ in nature: the rumen. About the size of a medicine ball, the organ is essentially a forty-five-gallon fermentation tank in which a resident population of bacteria dines on grass. Living their unseen lives at the far end of the food chain that culminates in a hamburger, these bacteria have, just like the grasses, coevolved with the cow, whom they feed.",

As we embrace the convenience and connectivity of the online world, we must also grapple with the challenges it poses to our personal privacy and security. One of the primary concerns is data privacy. Tech giants and online platforms collect vast amounts of data on individuals, often without their explicit consent. This data includes personal information, browsing habits, and even location data. The misuse or mishandling of such data can have severe consequences, from identity theft to invasive targeted advertising. Another issue is the erosion of anonymity. Our online activities are often tracked, leaving a digital trail of our behavior and preferences. This loss of anonymity can lead to unwarranted surveillance, online harassment, and the chilling effect on free speech as individuals become hesitant to express their views openly. Furthermore, the rise of social media has exacerbated concerns about privacy. Sharing personal information and updates on social networks can expose individuals to risks such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and the unintended spread of private content. Legislation and regulations regarding digital privacy are still evolving and often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. It is essential for individuals to take proactive steps to protect their digital privacy, such as using secure passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious about sharing personal information online. Moreover, raising awareness about digital privacy issues and advocating for stronger privacy protections are crucial steps in addressing this growing concern.

    "content": "A marketing objective is a marketing target or goal that an organization hopes to achieve such as to boost market share from 9 to 12 per cent within 2 years. Marketing objectives steer the direction of the business. Operating a business without knowing your objectives is like driving a car without knowing where you want to go. Some businesses achieve a degree of success without setting marketing objectives; stumbling across a successful business model by accident. But why should anyone rely on chance? If firms set marketing objectives the probability of success increases because decision making will be more focused. Marketing objectives must be compatible with the overall objectives of the company, they cannot be set in isolation by the marketing department. Achieving the marketing objective of boosting share from 9 to 12 per cent will help realize a corporate objective of growth. To be effective, marketing objectives should be quantifiable and measurable. Targets should also be set within a time frame. An example of a marketing objective that Nestle might set is to achieve a 9 per cent increase in the sales of KitKat by the end of next year. A car manufacturer, such as BMW could set the following marketing objective: 'To increase the number of BMW 3 Series cars sold in China from 250,000 to 400,000 over the next 12 months'. Setting sales volume targets can be particularly important in industries such as car manufacturing because of the high fixed costs associated with operating in this market. If sales volume can be increased, the high fixed costs of operating will be spread across a greater number of units of output, reducing fixed costs per unit.",

    "content": "Polio was one of the most feared viruses in the 1940s and 1950s. Outbreaks caused more than 15,000 cases of paralysis each year until vaccines were introduced beginning in 1955. Thanks to the polio vaccine and vigilant public health efforts encouraging people to fully vaccinate their children, wild (naturally spread) poliovirus has been eliminated from the United States for more than 30 years. Poliovirus is very contagious. It is spread through person-to-person contact via the stool of an infected person or the droplets of a sneeze or cough. Most people who contract poliovirus have no symptoms. About a quarter of them have mild, flu-like symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, upset stomach and body aches. Most people may not be aware they have polio. But about 1 in 200 to 1 in 1,000 people who become infected will develop a paralytic version of the disease known as poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis can range in severity from mild disability to acute respiratory failure and death. People who have been vaccinated against the virus have almost no chance of getting paralytic polio. Despite public health efforts to vaccinate all children against polio, some people in the U.S. may not have received the oral or injectable vaccine or gotten a full four-shot protocol. Those individuals are at risk of contracting polio. This includes young children. The only polio vaccine currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the inactivated polio vaccine. It is given by shot in the arm or leg, depending on the person's age. The CDC recommends that children get four doses at 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and 4-6 years.",
    "answer": "Polio was a significant threat in the 1940s and 1950s, leading to thousands of paralysis cases annually until the introduction of vaccines in 1955, which combined with public health campaigns promoting comprehensive vaccination, has successfully eliminated wild poliovirus from the United States for over three decades.",

    "content": "Goosebumps are the result of piloerection, a temporary raising of the hairs on the surface of the skin that occurs when the piloerector muscles contract. These tiny muscles are attached to the individual follicles from which each hair arises. Piloerection is a voluntary response directed by the sympathetic nervous system (the one that triggers the \"fight or flight\" response), and is elicited by cold, fear or a startling experience. Goosebumps have two functions that serve little purpose to less hairy, modern-day humans. \"One is to keep us warm, which they don't do a very good job at on humans because we're not furry,\" Roach, a physician from Canada says. For example, cold weather can trigger piloerection in mammals — as well as birds — causing their hair (or sometimes their feathers) to stand up and then reset. This action can create a layer of air underneath the animal's fur that helps insulate their bodies from the cold temperatures. Piloerection also occurs when animals perceive a threat is near. In this situation, when the piloerector muscles contract and cause the hair to rise, it creates a \"fluffed up\" appearance that makes the animal seem larger and may help deter an attack by other animals. As a result, goosebumps serve no real purpose in humans since we evolved to less hairy creatures.",
    "answer": "Goosebumps, a result of piloerection caused by the contraction of piloerector muscles, are a vestigial response in modern humans, originating as an evolutionary trait for insulation in cold weather and a defense mechanism to appear larger when threatened, which remains in our physiology but has little practical function due to reduced body hair.",

    "content": "At 29,029 feet (8,848 meters), Mount Everest is the world's tallest peak and an irresistible and (and sometimes deadly) draw for mountain climbers from all over the planet. It's also a place of political turmoil and intrigue, straddling the border of China and Nepal, which offer up different regulations for would-be adventurers. In late December 2017, Nepal's newest set of rules came under fire from some quarters for banning blind, amputee, and solo climbers.\n\nThe Nepalese tourism ministry tweaked the regulations in what it says is an effort to curb fatalities on the legendary slopes, which are steep, shifty, and so high that most climbers need supplemental oxygen to reach the summit. The moves would also create jobs for locals to act as guides for solo climbers.\n\nSome suspect that the new rules may be a ham-handed way to limit the ever-burgeoning crowds that now flood the slopes during the climbing season, which lasts for just a short time each year (mostly April and May) due to severe weather. Human waste, litter, and bottlenecks on narrow slopes make Everest look more like a packed movie theater queue than a wilderness journey on some days.\n\nAdventurer and author Brian Dickinson summited Everest in 2011. \"Over the past few decades Everest has had some bad press based on unqualified climbers,\" he says. \"Nepal is struggling to find an answer on how to control who should and shouldn't climb, but they are focusing on the wrong demographic. They probably feel that others seeing blind and disabled climbers attempting the mountain makes the climb appear doable for anyone.\"\n",

    "content": "The process of researching and securing a dig site can take years. Digging is the field work of archaeology. On occasion, archaeologists might need to move earth with bulldozers and backhoes. Usually, however, archaeologists use tools such as brushes, hand shovels, and even toothbrushes to scrape away the earth around artifacts. The most common tool that archaeologists use to dig is a flat trowel. A trowel is a hand-held shovel used for smoothing as well as digging. Archaeologists use trowels to slowly scrape away soil. For very small or delicate remains, archaeologists might also dig with dental picks, spoons, or very fine blades. Often, they will sift dirt through a fine mesh screen. Tiny remains, such as beads, can often be found this way.\n\nArchaeologists take lots of notes and photographs along each step of the process. Sometimes they include audio and video recordings. Global positioning system (GPS) units and data from geographic information systems (GIS) help them map the location of various features with a high level of precision. When archaeologists find remains, they are often broken or damaged after hundreds or even thousands of years underground. Sunlight, rain, soil, animals, bacteria, and other natural processes can cause artifacts to erode, rust, rot, break, and warp.\n\nSometimes, however, natural processes can help preserve materials. For example, sediments from floods or volcanic eruptions can encase materials and preserve them. In one case, the chill of an Alpine glacier preserved the body of a man for more than 5,300 years! The discoverer of the so-called “Iceman,” found in the Alps between Switzerland and Italy, thought he was a recent victim of murder, or one of the glacier’s crevasses. Forensic archaeologists studying his body were surprised to learn that he was a murder victim—the crime just took place more than 5,000 years ago.",

But scientists have doubted the story. An illustration of Alexander Von Humboldt’s story of the battle between horses and electric eels.\n\n“The first time I read von Humboldt's tale, I thought it was completely bizarre,” Catania says. “Why would the eels attack the horses instead of swimming away?” But then he observed the same behaviour by accident as he transferred the eels in his lab from one tank to another using a metal-rimmed net. Instead of swimming away, larger eels attacked the net by leaping out of the water.\n\nCatania tracked the strength of the eels’ electric shock by attaching a voltmeter to an aluminium plate, or conductive metal strips to “predator” objects such as a crocodile head replica. The zap a submerged eel distributes through the water is relatively weak when it reaches the target.\n\nBut when an eel touches it with its electricity-generating chin, the current travels directly to the target and has to travel through its body before it gets back to the water, Catania reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“This allows the eels to deliver shocks with a maximum amount of power to partially submerged land animals that invade their territory,” Catania explains. “It also allows them to electrify a much larger portion of the invader's body.”\n\nCatania found the eels leapt to attack, rather than receded, more often when the water in the aquarium was lower. He argues the attack lets electric eels better defend themselves during the Amazonian dry season, when they’re cornered in small pools and make easy prey.",
    "answer": "Electric eels defend its territory by leaping out of water to induce electric shock to the intruders, as researcher’s experiment revealed that this method not only inflicts stronger shock but also enables the eels a broader area to strike, which makes it a more effective defence mechanism compared to striking under the water or swimming away.",

Believed to be the mark of something special, a birth caul may appear startling and sometimes frightening for the mother, but the majority of the time, it's just a minor and harmless part of the birth process.\n\nA birth caul is a piece of the amniotic sac still attached to a newly born baby's head or face. In extremely rare cases, a baby emerges fully inside the amniotic sac, which looks like a thin and filmy membrane. Some call this condition \"born with a veil.\" A caul happens when a piece of the sac breaks away during gestation or during the birthing process and attaches itself to the baby's head. The doctor or midwife simply peels away the caul without issue, although in rare cases, if the caul is tightly adhered to the baby's head, they must take great care not to tear the baby's skin.\n\nMany cultures consider a baby born with a caul a sign of good luck.

Both primary carers and the larger group of other carers (close to 2 million) contribute to the wellbeing of older people and people with disabilities. However, because they care for people who otherwise would have difficulty carrying out basic everyday activities, there is particular interest in primary carers: in the contribution they make, their wellbeing, labour force experiences, motivations and the support they receive in caring.\n\nPrimary carers were more likely than other carers to be assisting someone who lived in the same household (81% compared with 76%). As with caring as a whole, the likelihood of being a primary carer increased with age to peak at age 55-64 years, where one in twenty people were primary carers. However, rather than then declining, the likelihood of being a primary carer remained at around this level among the older age groups. Consequently, primary carers had a somewhat older age profile than other carers.

The problem is how much television a child watches and what effect it has on his life. Research has shown that as the amount of time spent watching TV goes up, the amount of time devoted not only to homework and study but other important aspects of life such as social development and physical activities decreases. Television is bound to have it tremendous impact on a child, both in terms of how many hours a week he watches TV and of what he sees. When a parent is concerned about the effects of television, he should consider a number of things: what TV offers the child in terms of information and knowledge, how many hours a week a youngster his age should watch television, the impact of violence and sex, and the influence of commercials.\n\nWhat about the family as a whole? Is the TV set a central piece of furniture in your home! Is it flicked on the moment someone enters the empty house? Is it on during the daytime? Is it part of the background noise of your family life?

    "content": "If women are so far ahead of men, why are they so far behind? Reports from both sides of the Atlantic show that female students dominate university courses, yet women still do not make it to the top. A report on inequality in the UK said last week that girls had better educational results than boys at 16, went to university in greater numbers and achieved better degrees once they got there. “More women now have higher education qualifications than men in every age group up to age 44,” the report said. In the US, 57 per cent of college graduates in 2006-07 were women. Women form the majority of all graduates under 45.\n\nYet few women make it to the boards of companies in either country. In the UK, the proportion of women on FTSE 100 boards rose fractionally from 11.7 per cent to 12.2 per cent last year, according to the Cranfield University School of Management, but that was only because of a fall in the size of the boards. In the US, women accounted for 15.2 per cent of board seats on Fortune 500 companies, according to Catalyst, the research organisation, which said the numbers had barely budged for five years. The hopeful way of looking at this is that the rising generation of female graduates has yet to reach director age. Give it 10 years and they will dominate boards as they do universities. If that were true, however, we would surely see the number of women director numbers moving up by now. The first year that women college graduates outnumbered men in the US was 1982. These graduates must be entering their 50s – prime director age. ",

    "content": "Madeline Gannon is a researcher, teacher at the Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture and Ph.D. candidate in Computational Design — but that’s not all. She is on a mission to open up the infinite design possibilities of 3D printing to the world. “Currently you have to have a lot of technical background in order to participate in creating things for 3D printers,” Gannon says. “There is still a huge knowledge barrier for how we create digital models.” As the technology has advanced, prices have plummeted, and now anyone can buy a 3D printer for a few hundred dollars, Gannon notes. However, not just anyone can create original designs for 3D-printed artifacts. To put true creative power into the hands of any ordinary 3D printer owner, Gannon has developed an innovative new system called “Tactum.” Tactum is a new type of software that lets users create their own unique designs for 3D printers by simply touching a projected image. Using their innate hand gestures, someone using Tactum can poke, rub and otherwise manipulate the projected image that will become their 3D printed object, and see it instantly change shape in response.\n\nIn keeping with the goal of democratizing the process, Gannon designed her first series of Tactum artifacts on a surface that everyone can access freely and manipulate instinctively, that being the human body. “My goal was to bring the digital out to the physical world and out onto your body,” says Gannon. Along with a companion project called Reverb — which translates these user-created designs into printable meshes — that impulse has resulted in a spectacular diversity of bracelet and necklace designs, ranging from smooth landscapes, intricate textures and chaotic free forms to delicate geometries derived from the 19th century art of chronography.",

    "content": "Becoming a screenwriter starts with developing your talent as a writer, and the best way to develop your talent as a writer is to write. Your first project doesn't need to be a screenplay or TV script. You just need to start somewhere; essays, short stories, plays, etc. The idea is to become comfortable with the writing process, a surprisingly slow and frustrating experience, and find what they call your \"voice.\" Over time, you'll discover if your talents lie primarily with comedy, drama or some combination of the two.\n\nSome people find it helpful to develop their writing skills in a structured educational setting, whether it's a college course, a film school program, or an online writing workshop. The advantage of taking a class is that there are deadlines and grades motivating you to sit down and get to work. At film school, in particular, you also have access to a community of artists, writers and filmmakers from which to draw inspiration and fresh ideas. And if you're lucky, friends and connections you make in film school could lead to your first industry job.\n\nBut formal classes and degrees are certainly not required to become a screenwriter. You can create your own personal film school, renting and studying the greatest films and TV shows. There are several free and pay Web sites for reading film and TV scripts online. And there's no shortage of books written for aspiring screenwriters. The most famous is Syd Field's \"Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting.\" Since digital video technology is so affordable, you can always get together with a group of friends and write and produce your own films to gain experience.",
    "answer": "To become a screenwriter, start by developing your writing skills through various forms of writing to discover your \"voice,\" consider formal education in screenwriting or create your own learning path by studying films, reading scripts, and using available resources, as both paths offer opportunities to improve and gain experience in the field.",

    "content": "Let us begin by asking why the conviction that our language is decaying is so much more widespread than the belief that it is progressing. In an intellectual climate where the notion of the survival of the fittest is at least as strong as the belief in inevitable decay, it is strange that so many people are convinced of the decline in the quality of English, a language which is now spoken by an estimated half billion people – a possible hundredfold increase in the number of speakers during the past millennium.\n\nOne's first reaction is to wonder whether the members of the anti-slovenliness brigade, as we may call them, are subconsciously reacting to the fast-moving world we live in, and consequently resenting change in any area of life. To some extent this is likely to be true. A feeling that ‘fings ain’t wot they used to be’ and an attempt to preserve life unchanged seem to be natural reactions to insecurity, symptoms of growing old. Every generation inevitably believes that the clothes, manners and speech of the following one have deteriorated. We would therefore expect to find a respect for conservative language in every century and every culture and, in literate societies, a reverence for the language of the ‘best authors’ of the past.",
    "answer": "Despite the fact that English has been studied and spoken by a significantly increasing number of populations, people still overexaggerate that language is decaying and currently so often disapprove of the language alterations, and much of the dislike turns out to be based on social prejudice which needs to be stripped away.",

Do squirrels in captivity tend to live longer than wild squirrels live? Sometimes they do. Red squirrels can live up to eight years in captivity compared to about five years in the wild. The average life span of a gray squirrel in captivity keeps increasing. They can live as long as 20 years as a pet compared to six years in the wild.\n\nFox squirrels also live longer as pets.

    "content": "In 1815 on the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia, a handsome and long-quiescent mountain named Tambora exploded spectacularly, killing a hundred thousand people with its blast and associated tsunamis. It was the biggest volcanic explosion in ten thousand years—150 times the size of Mount St. Helens, equivalent to sixty thousand Hiroshima-sized atom bombs.\n\nNews didn’t travel terribly fast in those days. In London, The Times ran a small story— actually a letter from a merchant—seven months after the event. But by this time Tambora’s effects were already being felt. Thirty-six cubic miles of smoky ash, dust, and grit had diffused through the atmosphere, obscuring the Sun’s rays and causing the Earth to cool. Sunsets were unusually but blearily colourful, an effect memorably captured by the artist J. M. W. Turner, who could not have been happier, but mostly the world existed under an oppressive, dusky pall. It was this deathly dimness that inspired the Byron lines above.\n\nSpring never came and summer never warmed: 1816 became known as the year without summer. Crops everywhere failed to grow. In Ireland a famine and associated typhoid epidemic killed sixty-five thousand people. In New England, the year became popularly known as Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death. Morning frosts continued until June and almost no planted seed would grow. Short of fodder, livestock died or had to be prematurely slaughtered. In every way it was a dreadful year—almost certainly the worst for farmers in modern times. Yet globally the temperature fell by only about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Earth’s natural thermostat, as scientists would learn, is an exceedingly delicate instrument.",

Is this true? Development in the past was driven by growth and innovation. It led to new technologies and huge improvements in living standards. To assume that we know what the circumstances or needs of future generations will be is mistaken and inevitably leads to the debilitating sense that we are living on borrowed time.\n\nOnly if we assume that society will remain static can we understand the needs of the future. The way we live today could not have been predicted twenty years ago. The sustainability paradigm fails to recognize this. It is a static view and thus places limits on human ingenuity. Similarly, a whole host of false assumptions dominate environmental thought; the scale of problems is exaggerated, the amount of resources is underestimated and spurious links are made between areas such as green policies and profit, poverty and environmental degradation. Those of us who want a better future need to question these assumptions.",

    "content": "This year’s Nobel Peace Prize justly rewards the thousands of scientists of the United Nations Climate Change Panel (the IPCC). These scientists are engaged in excellent, painstaking work that establishes exactly what the world should expect from climate change.\n\nThe other award winner, former US Vice President Al Gore, has spent much more time telling us what to fear. While the IPCC’s estimates and conclusions are grounded in careful study, Gore doesn’t seem to be similarly restrained.\n\nGore told the world in his Academy Award-winning movie (recently labeled “one-sided” and containing “scientific errors” by a British judge) to expect 20-foot sea-level rises over this century. He ignores the findings of his Nobel co- winners, the IPCC, who conclude that sea levels will rise between only a half-foot and two feet over this century, with their best expectation being about one foot. That’s similar to what the world experienced over the past 150 years.\n\nLikewise, Gore agonizes over the accelerated melting of ice in Greenland and what it means for the planet, but overlooks the IPCC’s conclusion that, if sustained, the current rate of melting would add just three inches to the sea level rise by the end of the century. Gore also takes no notice of research showing that Greenland’s temperatures were higher in 1941 than they are today.\n\nGore also frets about the future of polar bears. He claims they are drowning as their icy habitat disappears. However, the only scientific study showing any such thing indicates that four polar bears drowned because of a storm.\n\nThe politician-turned-movie maker loses sleep over a predicted rise in heat-related deaths. There’s another side of the story that’s inconvenient to mention: rising temperatures will reduce the number of cold spells, which are a much bigger killer than heat. The best study shows that by 2050, heat will claim 400,000 more lives, but 1.8 million fewer will die because of cold. Indeed, according to the first complete survey of the economic effects of climate change for the world, global warming will actually save lives.",

    "content": "It’s important to realise that the brain doesn’t see the world around it simply as though the scene was projected onto a cinema screen on the inside of your skull. Before a scene can be observed “in your head” it has to be broken down into a number of different components for processing, and these components then have to be recombined into the meaningful form that we call “an image”. Amongst other things, the scene is broken down into its different colours – red, green and blue – in a way that’s analogous to the manner in which a television image or magazine photograph is broken down into tiny dots of primary colours (which are too small to be noticed individually when we look at them, but which when seen collectively give the impression of a continuous full colour image). However, unlike TV and magazine images, the image that we see with our eyes is broken down not only into separate colour components but into other components too. It is, rather incredibly, deconstructed into component parts such as horizontal lines, vertical lines, circles and so on. Each of these component parts is sent to a separate area of the brain for processing, with the different components of the scene only merging again when they are unified into what you perceive as the image.",

They enter the oceans through litter, when waste such as plastic bags, packaging and other convenience materials are discarded. Vast amounts of these end up in the sea, through inadequate waste disposal systems and sewage outfall.\n\nAnother growing source is microbeads, tiny particles of hard plastics that are used in cosmetics, for instance as an abrasive in modern skin cleaners. These easily enter waterways as they are washed off as they are used, flushed down drains and forgotten, but can last for decades in our oceans.\n\nThe impact of these materials has been hard to measure, despite being a growing source of concern. Small particles of plastics have been found in seabirds, fish and whales, which swallow the materials but cannot digest them, leading to a build-up in their digestive tracts.\n\nFor the first time, scientists have demonstrated that fish exposed to such materials during their development show stunted growth and increased mortality rates, as well as changed behaviour that could endanger their survival.",

Unable to keep all this in their memories, our ancestors created systems of written records that evolved over millennia into today’s written language.\n\nBut this ancient IT is already becoming obsolete.

    "content": "A medical doctor and professor for international health at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute, Rosling became famous as the public educator who used statistics to show how the world is changing. He chose this public role after making two significant discoveries.\n\nRosling’s first discovery was that many people are not aware of even the most basic facts about global health and global development. Through surveys he conducted, Rosling found that at a time when poverty is falling faster than ever before, the majority of people think that the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty is rising. Similarly, he found that many underestimate global life expectancy widely, and are not aware of the success of delivering healthcare services—for example, vaccines—globally. He found that people’s worldviews often do not have much grounding in facts, even long before the “post-fact” era.\n\nRosling was convinced that this unawareness of global progress matters. He made it his mission to fight this “devastating ignorance” that turns us into cynics, as we falsely believe that global development must be a mirage.\n\nRosling’s second discovery was that this lack of factual knowledge was not because people are not interested in global development, but because it is too hard for those that want to know about global development to access this knowledge. Neither the experts nor the media were presenting how global development changes the world.\n\nBased on these two insights, Hans Rosling made it his mission to bridge this gap and present the evidence that global development is a reality. His approach to communicating research on global development was through public talks and the use of data visualisation.",

Diaspora consciousness is on the rise - diasporas are becoming more interested in their origins, and organizing themselves more effectively; homelands are revising their opinions of their diasporas as the stigma attached to emigration declines, and stepping up their engagement efforts; meanwhile, host countries are witnessing more assertive diasporic groups within their own national communities, worrying about fifth columns and foreign lobbies, and suffering outbreaks of ‘diasporaphobia’.\n\nThis trend is the result of five factors, all of them connected with globalization: the growth in international migration; the revolution in transport and communications technology, which is quickening the pace of diasporas’ interactions with their homelands; a reaction against global homogenized culture, which is leading people to rethink their identities; the end of the Cold War, which increased the salience of ethnicity and nationalism and created new space in which diasporas can operate; and policy changes by national governments on issues such as dual citizenship and multiculturalism, which are enabling people to lead transnational lives.

    "content": "In my research, beginning with a survey of 80,000 managers conducted by the Gallup Organization and continuing during the past two years with in-depth studies of a few top performers, I’ve found that while there are as many styles of management as there are managers, there is one quality that sets truly great managers apart from the rest: They discover what is unique about each person and then capitalize on it. Average managers play checkers, while great managers play chess. The difference? In checkers, all the pieces are uniform and move in the same way; they are interchangeable. You need to plan and coordinate their movements, certainly, but they all move at the same pace, on parallel paths. In chess, each type of piece moves in a different way, and you can’t play if you don’t know how each piece moves. More important, you won’t win if you don’t think carefully about how you move the pieces. Great managers know and value the unique abilities and even the eccentricities of their employees, and they learn how best to integrate them into a coordinated plan of attack.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what great leaders do. Great leaders discover what is universal and capitalize on it. Their job is to rally people toward a better future. Leaders can succeed in this only when they can cut through differences of race, sex, age, nationality, and personality and, using stories and celebrating heroes, tap into those very few needs we all share. The job of a manager, meanwhile, is to turn one person’s particular talent into performance. Managers will succeed only when they can identify and deploy the differences among people, challenging each employee to excel in his or her own way. This doesn’t mean a leader can’t be a manager or vice versa. But to excel at one or both, you must be aware of the very different skills each role requires.",
    "answer": "Great managers distinguish themselves from average mangers by identifying and capitalizing unique traits of individuals through appropriate delegation instead of across-the-board governing style, whereas great leaders identify common grounds and reconcile differences between people in order to amass them for collective goals, to master both roles one must recognize distinctions between them.",

    "content": "In around 2300 BP (Before Present), hunter-gatherers called the San acquired domestic stock in what is now modern day Botswana. Their population grew, and spread throughout the Western half of South Africa. They were the first pastoralists in southern Africa, and called themselves Khoikhoi (or Khoe), which means 'men of men' or 'the real people'. This name was chosen to show pride in their past and culture. The Khoikhoi brought a new way of life to South Africa and to the San, who were hunter-gatherers as opposed to herders. This led to misunderstandings and subsequent conflict between the two groups.\n\nThe Khoikhoi were the first native people to come into contact with the Dutch settlers in the mid 17th century. As the Dutch took over land for farms, the Khoikhoi were dispossessed, exterminated, or enslaved and therefore their numbers dwindled. The Khoikhoi were called the ‘Hottentots’ by European settlers because the sound of their language was so different from any European language, and they could not pronounce many of the words and sounds.\n\nThe Khoikhoi used a word while dancing that sounded like ‘Hottentots’ and therefore settlers referred to the Khoikhoi by this name – however today this term is considered derogatory. The settlers used the term ‘Bushmen’ for the San, a term also considered derogatory today. Many of those whom the colonists called ‘Bushmen’ were in fact Khoikhoi or former Khoikhoi. For this reason, scholars sometimes find it convenient to refer to hunters and herders together as ‘Khoisan’.\n\nWhen European settlement began, Khoikhoi groups called the Namaqua were settled in modern day Namibia and the north-eastern Cape; others, including the Korana, along the Orange River; and the Gonaqua, interspersed among the Xhosa in the Eastern Cape. But the largest concentration of Khoikhoi, numbering in the tens of thousands inhabited the well-watered pasture lands of the south-western Cape. These Karoo ‘Cape’ Khoikhoi would be the first African population to bear the brunt of White settlement.",

The act empowered the United States Secretary to pilot and run conservation programs for indigenous species on the brink of extinction.\n\nThe Endangered Species Preservation Act was the government’s response to the declining numbers of the whooping crane, a bird species indigenous to North America. Two years later, in 1968, the government increased conservation efforts for America’s indigenous species and bought 2,300 acres in Florida. This enhanced protection for the National Key Deer through the National Key Deer Refuge. The government first established the refuge in 1957.\n\nThe U.S. was on the right step in protecting its animals and plants, then saw the need to expand the law to cover international species. It all started in the 1960s with a recording of the sound made by humpback whales. Their numbers were also dwindling, so much so that the International Whaling Commission temporarily stopped whale hunting. This meant that the ban would be lifted once the whale population stabilized. Conservationists were also watching, and the United States also had to act.\n\nThe Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966, therefore, evolved into the Endangered Species Conservation Act in 1969. The U.S. could now add international species to its endangered species list and ban imports of products made from those species.",

It is essential to prioritize and nurture our mental health to lead a fulfilling and balanced life. Firstly, self-awareness is key. Take time to reflect on your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Understanding your feelings and identifying stressors can help you manage and cope with them effectively. Secondly, establish a support system. Share your thoughts and feelings with trusted friends or family members. Connecting with others can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation. Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques can significantly impact mental health. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help reduce stress and improve emotional well-being. Setting realistic goals and managing time effectively can reduce feelings of overwhelm. Break tasks into manageable steps and prioritize self-care to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is also crucial. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep contribute to mental well-being. Limiting the consumption of alcohol and avoiding substance abuse are essential for maintaining good mental health. Lastly, seeking professional help when needed is a sign of strength, not weakness. If you're struggling with mental health issues like depression or anxiety, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional for guidance and support. In conclusion, nurturing your mental well-being is a continuous journey that involves self-awareness, building a support system, practicing mindfulness, setting realistic goals, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and seeking professional help when necessary. Prioritizing mental health leads to a happier and more balanced life.",

    "content": "In 2005 Japan had the highest median age of all countries in the world, while Australia's population was only moderately aged. Some 50 years ago the demographic situation was quite different, with the median age of Australia's population being seven years older than Japan's.\n\nThe ageing of the population is a major issue for Australian policy makers, particularly in regard to the long-term implications for reduced economic growth and the increasing demand for Age Pensions, and health and aged care services. As the population ages, growth in the number of people of working age will slow, while the proportion of people of retirement age will increase.\n\nSustained population ageing also leads to slowing or negative population growth. While declining population growth in developed countries is welcomed by some environmentalist and social scientists, economists tend to agree that population decline brings gloomy economic prospects. In addition to the decrease in the labour supply, the demand side of the economy may be affected through shrinking markets for goods and services.\n\nHow quickly this occurs depends on the dynamics of fertility, mortality and overseas migration. While a moderate pace of demographic change allows for gradual adjustment of the economy and policies to the changing population demographics, rapid changes are more difficult to manage. As a result, governments and society as a whole may need to take actions to address these issues. But how severe is the ageing of Australia's population, relative to other countries?\n\nOne way of applying a degree of perspective to the ageing debate is to compare ageing in Australia with that of other countries. This article examines the population structures in Australia and Japan and the demographic forces that shape the respective populations, both historically and projections for the future.\n\nIn 2005 Japan's population was ranked the oldest in the world, with half the people aged over 42.9 years. In comparison, Australia's median age is not projected to reach this level until 2032. Japan's population is projected to decline by 21% between 2005 and 2050 (from 128 million to 101 million). Over the same period, Australia's population is projected to increase by 38% from 20 million to 28 million people.\n\nFifty years ago the demographic situation of these countries was the reverse, with Australia's median age (30.1 years) being almost 7 years older than that of Japan (23.7 years).",

    "content": "To bring fresh water to the city, his hydraulic engineer, Eugène Belgrand, built a new aqueduct to bring clean water from the Vanne River in Champagne, and a new huge reservoir near the future Parc Montsouris. These two works increased the water supply of Paris from 87,000 to 400,000 cubic metres of water a day. He laid hundreds of kilometres of pipes to distribute the water throughout the city, and built a second network, using the less-clean water from the Ourq and the Seine, to wash the streets and water the new park and gardens.\n\nThe population of Paris had doubled since 1815, with no increase in its area. To accommodate the growing population and those who would be forced from the centre by the new boulevards and squares Napoleon III planned to build, he issued a decree annexing eleven surrounding communes, and increasing the number of arrondissements from twelve to twenty, which enlarged the city to its modern boundaries. Beginning in 1854, in the centre of the city, Haussmann's workers tore down hundreds of old buildings and cut eighty kilometres of new avenues, connecting the central points of the city. Buildings along these avenues were required to be the same height and in a similar style, and to be faced with cream-coloured stone, creating the signature look of Paris boulevards.\n\nNapoleon III also wanted to build new parks and gardens for the recreation and relaxation of the Parisians, particularly those in the new neighbourhoods of the expanding city. Napoleon III's new parks were inspired by his memories of the parks in London, especially Hyde Park, where he had strolled and promenaded in a carriage while in exile; but he wanted to build on a much larger scale.

Thousands of workers and gardeners began to dig lakes, build cascades, plant lawns, flowerbeds, trees, and construct chalets and grottoes. Napoleon III created the Bois de Boulogne (1852–1858) to the west of Paris: the Bois de Vincennes (1860–1865) to the east; the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont (1865–1867) to the north, and Parc Montsouris (1865–1878) to the south.",

    "content": "If your recruiting efforts attract job applicants with too much experience—a near certainty in this weak labor market—you should consider a response that runs counter to most hiring managers’ MO: Don’t reject those applicants out of hand. Instead, take a closer look.\n\nNew research shows that overqualified workers tend to perform better than other employees, and they don’t quit any sooner. Furthermore, a simple managerial tactic—empowerment—can mitigate any dissatisfaction they may feel.\n\nThe prejudice against too-good employees is pervasive. Companies tend to prefer an applicant who is a “perfect fit” over someone who brings more intelligence, education, or experience than needed. On the surface, this bias makes sense: Studies have consistently shown that employees who consider themselves overqualified exhibit higher levels of discontent. For example, over-qualification correlated well with job dissatisfaction in a 2008 study of 156 call-center reps by Israeli researchers Saul Fine and Baruch Nevo. And unlike discrimination based on age or gender, declining to hire overqualified workers is perfectly legal.\n\nBut even before the economic downturn, a surplus of overqualified candidates was a global problem, particularly in developing economies, where rising education levels are giving workers more skills than are needed to supply the growing service sectors. If managers can get beyond the conventional wisdom, the growing pool of too-good applicants is a great opportunity. Berrin Erdogan and Talya N. Bauer of Portland State University in Oregon found that overqualified workers’ feelings of dissatisfaction can be dissipated by giving them autonomy in decision making. At stores where employees didn’t feel empowered, “overeducated” workers expressed greater dissatisfaction than their colleagues did and were more likely to state an intention to quit. But that difference vanished where self-reported autonomy was high.",
    "answer": "The problem of overqualified workers is prevalent in the worldwide as they are correlated with job dissatisfaction, while this can be mitigated by employee empowerment so overqualified applicants are prone to have better performance and lower turnover comparing to other candidates, which provide a good opportunity for a business to grow.",

    "content": "Their trade networks made the Phoenicians rich but also enabled cultural exchange and transfer between East and West in an unprecedented way: the most significant was the spread of the alphabetic script which was adopted all over the Mediterranean. \n\nThe Phoenician alphabet is a writing system consisting of only 22 signs representing exactly one sound (phoneme) each. The term \"alphabet\" derives from the names of the first two signs in the sequence, aleph (\"cattle\") and beit (\"house\"): these names also reflect the letters' shapes, each derived from the picture of an object whose name starts with the relevant sound.\n\nThe alphabetic script is simple enough to learn quickly, without the years of dedicated training required to master writing systems such as cuneiform or Egyptian hieroglyphs. Specialised schooling was unnecessary, and literacy was therefore disengaged from the institutional context of palaces and temples where the traditional scripts continued to be used. The alphabet suited the needs of long-distance merchants who needed to be able to record their business affairs on the go and who, for reasons of confidentiality and money, often preferred to write themselves rather than employ a specialist scribe. As the script could easily be used to record any language, it was, in the course of the first millennium BC, adapted for Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, Phrygian, Lydian, Etruscan and Latin, to name but a few.",

    "content": "As warmer winter temperatures become more common, one way for some animals to adjust is to shift their ranges northward. But a new study of 59 North American bird species indicates that doing so is not easy or quick—it took about 35 years for many birds to move far enough north for winter temperatures to match where they historically lived.\n\nFor example, black vultures have spread northward in the last 35 years and now winter as far north as Massachusetts, where the minimum winter temperature is similar to what it was in Maryland in 1975. On the other hand, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker did not alter its range at all despite the warming trend, possibly because its very specific habitat requirements precluded a range shift.\n\nBoth of these scenarios could represent problems for birds, La Sorte says. Species that do not track changes in climate may wind up at the limits of their physiological tolerance, or they may lose important habitat qualities, such as favored food types, as those species pass them by. But they also can’t move their ranges too fast if the habitat conditions they depend on also tend to lag behind climate.",

According to findings presented today at the annual Experimental Biology conference, honey delivers a significant performance boost to athletes during strenuous exercise.\n\n\"Numerous studies have singled out carbohydrates as a critical nutrient in endurance exercise,\" says principal investigator Richard Kreider of the University of Memphis Exercise and Sport Nutrition Laboratory. \"Most of the studies to date have shown supplementation with glucose to provide the extra staying power. We were pleased to find that honey, a 'cocktail' of various natural sugars, performed just as well.\"\n\nThe team let nine competitive male cyclists cycle for 64 kilometers each week for three weeks, feeding them honey, dextrose gel or a flavored, calorie-free placebo. Participants received 15 grams of that supplement along with 250 millilitres of water before they raced and then every 16 kilometers while cycling.\n\nBoth the honey and the dextrose gel led to better times and more cycling power among the athletes, as compared with the placebos effects. While the dextrose gel slightly outperformed honey, the difference was negligible, leading the researchers to conclude that honey can be a natural and effective carbohydrate source for endurance athletes.",

It is strange that after decades of crawling up the political backside of the US, Australians don't have that right. Being fined for not voting reminds me of the old saying \"you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink\". The fine is not for failing to vote but for failing to have your name marked off a list! Forcing people to make a decision just means they'll make the easiest, quickest decision they can, not the best one. You need an informed electorate for compulsory voting to work. However, the reality is that nobody knows anything about the candidates and promotional material is not readily available. I'd rather 80% of people didn't vote than have them all just pick the first recognizable name on the ballot sheet. Then at least the government is elected by the 20% who care and make informed decisions. Otherwise it is largely pot chance who gets elected. Furthermore, compulsory voting doesn't ensure that the entire electorate is engaged in the democratic process. Those who don't want to vote can simply turn up and get their name marked off, without even putting pencil to paper. But you're seriously deluding yourself if you think that this is what all those who don't care about government do when they turn up to the polling booth. Voluntary voting at least ensures those who vote are the ones that care enough to do so. Perhaps somebody could enlighten me as to the reason why, to the best of my knowledge, Australia is the only 'democracy' that has compulsory voting.

One of the big reasons why weekday lunch and Sunday brunch buffets are so popular with restaurant owners is that they are major labor-saving devices, and therefore cost-saving devices.\n\nAaron Allen is a restaurant consultant and industry analyst. He explains that a buffet cuts back on staff throughout the restaurant.\n\n\"If the guest is walking through the buffet and plating their own food and basically serving themselves, you don't need as many front-of-house workers,\" says Allen, referring to waiters and bussers. \"And for the back-of-house kitchen staff, you don't need to have an a la carte culinary team making items to order. Just a few cooks can make items in batches and replenish, so you can work with a smaller crew and produce more volume.\"\n\nMatthew Britt, a chef and instructor at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island, says that lower staffing needs and the predictability of buffet cooking are a great way for an a la carte restaurant to balance risk. Britt says that with the rise of nouvelle cuisine in the 1970s and 1980s profit margins at restaurants became much thinner. \"There's a lot of uncertainty in a nouvelle cuisine dinner service. You don't know who's coming in or what they're going to order.

During the 18th century and 19th century, the influence of the British Empire began to spread around the world for the sake of industrial revolution, so English began to become popular. English was used not only in the British colonies but also in the diplomatic negotiations of non-English-speaking countries.\nHowever, no matter how powerful the adaptively is and how large the area that the power of English covers, currently, the international status of English mainly springs from the status of America as a superpower after World War 2.\nBesides, with the development of the economic globalization and new political structure, there is a great need of an international language. As result, English became the first choice.",

In other words, it's easier and more affordable than ever for consumers to go buy a readily available electric or hybrid car, and these cars are more efficient, easier to charge, and have fewer compromises overall than EVs and hybrids of just a couple generations ago. That means there are more people who can take advantage of solar power to run a car, and that solar power will literally go farther than it would have in the past.\n\nThat said, solar panel technology has improved, too. It's more affordable and easier for most consumers to incorporate into a home or garage update, but solar-powered cars still have a long way to go.\n\nIn fact, it's unlikely that we'll see a car that can be fully powered by a solar panel integrated into the roof, because a panel that size is just too small to produce the power needed. EnergySage, a company that helps consumers research and shop for solar technology, estimates that a car completely covered in solar panels could only power an electric car for a maximum of 25 miles a day, and that's assuming weather and other conditions are absolutely perfect.

For a long time, that’s where we thought it all started, until an excavation in the Chinese village of Quanhuccun revealed a slightly different, much older story.\n\nAn examination of bones from several cats found in the ancient village revealed something startling, especially considering it wasn’t thought that cats were domesticated in China until about 2,000 years ago. The bones are approximately 5,300 years old, and they tell a story that’s much more complicated than just the life of a wild cat.\n\nTesting the cats’ bones revealed much more than just the time that they lived, it revealed something about their diet, too. By measuring the isotopes present in the bones, researchers got a feel for what the cats were eating, and part of the finding substantiated what’s largely been thought about how cats and humans first got together. Once humans settled into farming and agricultural communities, they started to store grain and other crops. This, in turn, attracted mice, rats, and other pests.

    "content": "Lake Baikal is located in southern Russia, near the border of Mongolia. Its depth of 5,300 feet makes it the world's deepest lake. The second-deepest lake, Lake Tanganyika in east Africa, is 4,710 feet deep by comparison. Crater Lake, the deepest lake in the U.S., is 1,900 feet deep.\n\nLake Baikal's 12,200-square-mile size also makes it Earth's largest. That size, by the way, makes it comparable in volume to the entire Amazon basin. For scale, it reportedly takes about 330 years for one water molecule to flow from inlet to inlet.\n\nSo how did Lake Baikal get so massive? About 25 million years ago, Lake Baikal formed through fractures and shifting within Earth's crust. It wasn't Lake Baikal as we now know it, though. Experts believe it was a series of lakes, similar to the Great Lakes in the U.S. While scientists aren't positive how Lake Baikal went from many lakes to the behemoth it is today, they do have theories. It could've been sinking earth, erosion, earthquakes, increased water from melting glaciers, although it's likely a mix of these factors and more.\n\nNow, that unifying change took place in the Pliocene Epoch (about 5.3 to 2.5 million years ago), but this lake is hardly finished growing. It's expanding at a rate of 0.7 inches every year, the same speed at which Africa and South America are drifting apart. At this speed, some scientists believe Lake Baikal is actually an ocean in the making.",

    "content": "With a good system of crop rotation, and especially with the addition of any sort of fertilizer you may be able to come up with, it’s possible to grow crops on a plot of land for upwards of 2 – 3 years at a time with good results. Ultimately, though, you must let the land rest if you hope to continue farming there in the long-run. Allowing a plot of land to rest for a period of time is known as letting the field go fallow, and there are several reasons for this.\n\nAllowing a field or plot to lie fallow means that you don’t grow anything new on it, don’t harvest anything and don’t graze any animals on the land for at least a year. Sometimes a field will lay fallow for two, three or even four years, but the traditional standard on many farms was to let a field lie fallow once every 2 – 3 years.\n\nThis fallow period allows the land to replenish many of its nutrients. The root networks of various grasses or groundcovers (like clover) have a chance to expand and grow, which further strengthens the soil and protects it from erosion.\n\nDuring the fallow period, there are many beneficial flora and micro-fauna, including cyanobacteria, which live in the soil. These microorganisms continue to be active at the root level, steadily improving the quality of the soil so that when you come back in a year or two, you can begin planting food or cash crops anew.",
    "answer": "Fallowing once every few years could alleviate farm land over use, as it provides much needed time to recuperate and restore the balance of the soil’s health through microbial growth, and this natural nourishment process ensures the land stay fertile for future planting.",

    "content": "The end of the Cretaceous Period saw one of the most dramatic mass extinctions the Earth has ever seen.\n\nThe fossil record shows that throughout their 160 million year existence, dinosaurs took on a huge variety of forms as the environment changed and new species evolved that were suited to these new conditions. Others that failed to adapt went extinct.\n\nBut then 66 million years ago, over a relatively short time, dinosaurs disappeared completely (except for birds). Many other animals also died out, including pterosaurs, large marine reptiles, and other sea creatures such as ammonites.\n\nAlthough the number of dinosaur species was already declining, this suggests a sudden catastrophic event sealed their fate, causing unfavourable changes to the environment more quickly than dinosaurs and other creatures could adapt.\n\nThe exact nature of this catastrophic event is still open to scientific debate. The catastrophe could have been an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions or the effect of both, together with more gradual changes in the Earth’s climate over millions of years.\n\nWhatever the causes, the huge extinction that ended the age of the dinosaur left gaps in the ecosystem that were subsequently filled by mammals and birds, allowing them to evolve rapidly.",

But as every teacher knows, many students do not learn what they are taught. Indeed, when we look at their work, it is sometimes hard to believe that they were in the classroom. In fact, it is impossible to predict with any certainty what students will learn as the result of a particular sequence of classroom activities. And because we cannot teach well without finding out where our students are starting from, we have to assess. Even if all our students started out at the same point (a highly unlikely situation!), each of them will have reached different understandings of the material being studied within a very short period of time. That is why assessment is the bridge between teaching and learning—it is only through assessment that we can find out whether what has happened in the classroom has produced the learning we intended.\n\nOf course, assessment is also used for other purposes in education, which makes the picture much more complicated. In all countries, assessments of the performance of individual students are used to determine which students are, and which students are not, qualified for subsequent phases of education, and also to decide which kinds of education students should receive.",

They were turned down time and time again -- government bureaucrats thought they were crackpots; others thought that if two bicycle mechanics could build a successful airplane, they could do it themselves. But the Wright persisted, and in late 1907, the U.S. Army Signal Corps asked for an aircraft. Just a few months later, in early 1908, a French syndicate of businessmen agreed to purchase another.\n\nBoth the U.S. Army and the French asked for an airplane capable of carrying a passenger. The Wright brothers hastily adapted their 1905 Flyer with two seats and a more powerful engine. They tested these modifications in secret, back at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina for the first time in several years. Then the brothers parted temporarily -- Wilbur to France and Orville to Virginia.\n\nIn 1908 and 1909, Wilbur demonstrated Wright aircraft in Europe, and Orville flew in Fort Meyer, Virginia. The flights went well until Orville lost a propeller and crashed, breaking his leg and killing his passenger Lt. Thomas Selfridge. While Orville recuperated, Wilbur kept flying in France, breaking record after record. Orville and his sister Kate eventually joined Wilbur in France, and the three returned home to Dayton to an elaborate homecoming celebration. Together, Orville and Wilbur returned to Fort Meyer with a new Military Flyer and completed the U.S. Army trials. A few months later, Wilbur flew before over a million spectators in New York Harbor -- his first public flight in his native land. All of these flights stunned and captivated the world. The Wright Brothers became the first great celebrities of the twentieth century.",

    "content": "Disabled people were among the early adopters of personal computers. They were quick to appreciate that word processing programs and printers gave them freedom from dependence on others to read and write for them. Similarly, although smaller devices like smartphones can have accessibility issues, some disabled people became early adopters due to their power for portable text-to-speech and later speech recognition capabilities. Some of these disabled early adopters became very knowledgeable about what could be achieved and used their knowledge to become independent students at a high level. They also gained the confidence to ask that providers of education make adjustments so that disabled students could make better use of course software and the web, rather than just word processing. In many countries pressure from these disabled people and their advocates has led to the creation of laws ensuring certain aspects of accessibility.\n\nFor some disability groups, information in electronic format (whether computer-based or web-based) can be more accessible than printed information. For example, people who have limited mobility or limited manual skills can find it difficult to obtain or hold printed material; visually impaired people can find it difficult or impossible to read print, but both these groups can be enabled to use a computer and, therefore, access the information electronically.\n\nOnline communication can enable disabled students to communicate with their peers on an equal basis. For example, a deaf student or a student with Asperger’s syndrome may find it difficult to interact in a face-to-face tutorial, but may have less difficulty interacting when using a text conferencing system in which everyone types and reads text.

    "content": "In the heart of rural India, a technological revolution is unfolding, one that promises to reshape the landscape of healthcare delivery. Telemedicine, the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients through telecommunications technology, has emerged as a beacon of hope in areas traditionally plagued by healthcare access challenges. Historically, India's rural populations have grappled with limited access to healthcare facilities. The reasons are manifold: geographic isolation, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and a scarcity of medical professionals. However, the advent of telemedicine is turning the tide. By leveraging the power of digital technology, medical expertise is being transported beyond urban centers, reaching the most remote villages.\n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of this technological marvel is its ability to provide timely medical consultations. Patients in remote areas can now connect with doctors and specialists hundreds of miles away, receiving diagnoses and medical advice without the need for extensive travel. This not only saves time but also reduces the financial burden on families who would otherwise incur significant travel expenses. Furthermore, telemedicine is playing a pivotal role in managing chronic diseases and providing preventive care. Regular virtual check-ups and monitoring have made it easier for patients to manage conditions like diabetes and hypertension, which require consistent medical attention. This is particularly important in India, where the prevalence of chronic diseases is on the rise.\n\nThe impact of telemedicine extends beyond patient care. It's also a tool for empowering local healthcare workers. Through virtual training and support, these workers are upskilled, enabling them to provide better care in their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, telemedicine is not just a technological advancement; it's a transformative force in rural India, bringing quality healthcare to the doorsteps of those who need it most. Its continued integration into India's healthcare system promises to bridge the urban-rural divide, heralding a new era of health equity and accessibility.",

It goes beyond academics and encompasses a sense of belonging, support, and engagement that plays a pivotal role in their educational journey.\n\nOne of the fundamental aspects of a vibrant campus community is the opportunity for students to connect with their peers. Friendships forged in college often last a lifetime and contribute to personal growth and well-being. These connections provide a support system that helps students navigate the challenges of academic life and transition into adulthood.\n\nFurthermore, an active and inclusive campus community fosters a sense of belonging. When students feel like they belong, they are more likely to be motivated, engaged, and committed to their studies. A sense of belonging reduces feelings of isolation and can improve mental health and overall happiness.\n\nStudent organizations, clubs, and extracurricular activities play a significant role in building this sense of community. They offer students opportunities to pursue their interests, discover new passions, and connect with like-minded individuals. These activities provide a platform for leadership development, teamwork, and personal growth outside the classroom.\n\nMoreover, a strong campus community enhances the overall college experience. It encourages students to attend events, lectures, and cultural activities, enriching their education beyond textbooks and lectures. It also promotes diversity and inclusion, exposing students to different perspectives and backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, a thriving campus community is not just a complement to education; it is an integral part of it.

    "content": "In the past two centuries there has been a dramatic change in the role of food and eating in Australian public consciousness. Public discussion of food was largely confined to matters of supply, distribution and price. Towards the end of the nineteenth century some newspapers were offering regular columns of advice on housekeeping topics, including menu planning and recipes. However, eating remained essentially a private activity, even when undertaken in company.\n\nBy the late twentieth century, food and eating had become prominent public preoccupations. Evidence of this dramatic cultural revaluation abounds. In bookstores, for example, cookery and all things related to it are often among the larger displays. There are specialty stores selling all manner of cookware, tableware and other paraphernalia associated with food, eating and drinking. \n\nPerhaps most telling is the extension of the phenomenon of mass media celebrity to include culinary personalities. Scholars, too, have jumped on the commodification bandwagon. Now degrees in gastronomy seem set to emulate the MBA phenomenon of the 1980s and food has become a respectable subject for investigation with philosophers, sociologists, historians, cultural theorists, ecologists and many others all having a go at it.\n\nSurprisingly, the question seems to have held little fascination for most historians. For the best part of two centuries they have managed to write their accounts of colonisation and nationhood with only scant reference to how the settlers and their descendants fed themselves.",

    "content": "You may think vampires are limited to the tales of undead humans drinking blood, but you might be surprised to learn about one peculiar so-called vampire tree found in the forests of New Zealand.\n\nScientists found vampire-like behavior in the stump of a living kauri tree. The tree had extended its roots into an interweaving community of surrounding trees, forming what the study authors called a ‘superorganism.’ The vampire tree grafts its roots onto dozens or even hundreds of other trees, sucking in the water and nutrients at night that the other trees spent all day collecting.\n\nWithout the water and nutrients drained from its neighbors, the kauri tree stump would most certainly be dead. It lacks green tissue of its own, according to study co-author Sebastian Leuzinger. As for why the host trees don’t cut off the leaching stump, Leuzinger and his colleges theorized the vampire tree’s superorganism acts as a network of water and nutrients, taking turns pumping resources to one another.\n\nLeuzinger and Bader went on to uncover the stump’s vampirish nature by measuring the flow of water in the stump and the surrounding trees of the same species. In effect, they found a strong negative correlation in the water flow between the trees. In other words, though genetically different, they were sharing resources thanks to grafted roots recognizing nearby root tissue.\n\nResearchers are looking for more types of kauri tree stumps to further study the formation of root systems between stumps and living trees. Should they discover more vampire trees and the scope of the research expands, a better understanding of such resource-sharing superorganisms may be significant to the longevity of forests.",

    "content": "The colours that we see are a result of the light reflected within a narrow range of wavelengths – what we call the visible spectrum. But sunlight also spans wavelengths that we cannot see. But there’s one set of wavelengths that elude all of us – these are near infra-red (NIR) wavelengths. And understanding how bird feathers interact with these wavelengths is important, not just for birds, but also for humans through the potential for improvements in thermal efficiency.\n\nOur research in the School of BioSciences at the University of Melbourne suggests that some Australian birds can control their temperature and avoid overheating by reflecting near-infrared wavelengths of sunlight.\n\nWe collected information on 90 species of Australian birds and found a very strong link between living in hot, arid regions and reflecting a higher proportion of near-infrared light. Researchers in the field of animal colouration have largely ignored near-infrared light, because it isn’t easy to measure and there’s no evidence that animals can see these wavelengths.

    "content": "Teenagers can look like adults, dress like adults, and even act like adults at times; sometimes, it might be hard to tell the teenagers from adults (and other times it isn’t hard at all), but it’s also crucial to remember that their brains are wired completely differently. It’s long been known that at the end of the day, teenagers just don’t think like adults, and that’s because the different sections of their brains aren’t connected the way they will be once they’ve matured a little more. Most specifically, teenagers lack many of the nerve connections that tie the frontal lobe to the rest of the brain, limiting their ability to think ahead.\n\nIt all has to do with the way the brain matures, a concept that’s been given the pretty logical name of neuromaturation. The brain is made up of white matter and grey matter. The grey matter stores all the information, and the white matter forms the connections between the different parts of the brain. Our grey matter matures when we’re between 11 and 12 years old, but the white matter hasn’t completely developed until we’re in our early twenties.\n\nThat means that the brains of teenagers literally aren’t physically fully connected. In an adult brain, there are a number of neural connections that allow the different parts of the brain to all work together. In the teenage brain, these connections aren’t fully formed yet, and it, unsurprisingly, impacts the brain’s ability to process information in a way that looks at the entire picture. It’s been found that the last part of the brain to finish developing its connections is the frontal lobe, which is also the part of the brain that governs attention span, impulses, and motivation. ",
    "answer": "Teenagers may sometimes resemble adults but their brains are structurally different due to incomplete neural connections, with grey matter maturing by around 11-12 years old and white matter connections developing into their early twenties, especially in the frontal lobe, which affects their ability to think ahead and make sound judgments.",

    "content": "The phenomenon of animal migration is one of the most captivating and awe-inspiring aspects of the natural world. It showcases the remarkable journeys undertaken by countless species, often spanning thousands of miles, in search of food, favorable breeding grounds, or milder climates. Migration is not limited to a single type of animal; it occurs among birds, mammals, fish, insects, and even some reptiles. Each species has its unique strategy and adaptations for making these epic journeys. One of the most renowned migrations is that of the monarch butterfly. These fragile insects travel from North America to Mexico, covering thousands of miles. Their journey is a marvel of precision and timing, as multiple generations of butterflies are involved in completing the round-trip migration.\n\nBirds, too, embark on incredible migrations. The Arctic tern, for example, holds the record for the longest migratory journey of any bird, traveling from the Arctic to the Antarctic and back, covering a staggering 44,000 miles annually. Marine animals like sea turtles and whales migrate vast distances as well. Sea turtles navigate across entire oceans to return to their nesting beaches, while humpback whales undertake migratory journeys between polar feeding grounds and tropical breeding areas. The reasons behind these journeys vary. Some animals migrate to find food, as is the case with many birds that travel to warmer regions in winter to access insect-rich environments. Others migrate for breeding purposes, seeking safe and suitable locations to reproduce and rear their young.\n\nAnimal migration is not only a testament to the extraordinary adaptability and instincts of these creatures but also a reminder of the interconnectedness of ecosystems across the globe. It is crucial to understand and protect these migration routes and habitats to ensure the survival of countless species.",

Yet, library executives did not see how such a phenomenon could become a part of library and information services. They felt that the users should be left to their social media while the library carried on with its traditional roles (De Rosa et al., 2007). This was also the case when Charnigo and Barnett-Ellis (2007) conducted a survey of 126 academic librarians and concluded that 54% of the librarians surveyed did not believe that there was an academic purpose for Facebook. The rationale behind these librarians’ belief was that the social media was a space where students interact with each other, hence, the librarian was not welcome as their coming in might be viewed as an invasion of space. But time has proved that as the technology of the social media became more popular, users and librarians acquired digitally literacy, and libraries, seeing an explosion of social media around it, were forced to reconsider their stance. In a survey involving 497 international librarians, Taylor & Francis (2014) discovered that over 70% of librarians now feel that the use of social media is important. Though the wave began with public libraries (Mon, 2015), today, libraries of every type either have a social media presence or they are seriously considering it. Hence, the use of social media by libraries has become mainstream.",

These communities, often deeply connected to their environment and traditions, are facing unprecedented challenges due to shifting weather patterns and environmental disruptions.\n\nHistorically, indigenous peoples have lived in harmony with nature, utilizing their knowledge of the land and its resources to sustain their way of life. However, the rapid pace of climate change has disrupted these delicate balances. Rising temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events are causing food shortages, water scarcity, and damage to traditional dwellings.\n\nResearch indicates that these environmental changes are not only threatening the physical well-being of indigenous peoples but also eroding their cultural heritage. Traditional knowledge, passed down through generations, is at risk of being lost as younger generations are forced to adapt to a changing world.\n\nIndigenous communities are actively participating in climate-related events and initiatives, raising awareness about the unique challenges they face and advocating for sustainable solutions. Their deep understanding of the environment and innovative approaches to adaptation can offer valuable insights for the broader global community in addressing climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change poses a profound threat to indigenous communities, impacting their way of life, culture, and heritage.

Its big on board batteries will have been fully charged overnight, with enough power for you to drive 50-100 kilometres through city traffic.\n\nWhen you arrive at work you'll plug in your car once again, this time into a socket that allows power to flow form your car's batteries to the electricity grid. One of the things you did when you bought your car was to sign a contract with your favourite electricity supplier, allowing them to draw a limited amount of power from your car's batteries should they need to, perhaps because of a blackout, or very high wholesale spot power prices. The price you get for the power the distributor buys from your car would not only be most attractive to you, it would be a good deal for them too, their alternative being very expensive power from peaking stations.\n\nIf, driving home or for some other reason your batteries looked like running flat, a relatively small, but quiet and efficient engine running on petrol, diesel or compressed natural gas, even biofuel, would automatically cut in, driving a generator that supplied the batteries so you could complete your journey.\n\nConcerns over 'peak oil', increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood that by the middle of this century there could be five times as many motor vehicles registered world-wide as there are now, mean that the world's almost total dependence on petroleum-based fuels for transport is, in every sense of the word, unsustainable.",

So far, only a few facilities actually have had to suspend operations due to COVID-19 cases among the workforce, according to Martin Bucknavage, a senior food safety extension associate in the food science department at Penn State University. But staying open has necessitated changes in practices that can slow down and limit output.\n\n\"These precautions are necessary to help protect workers who may work in close proximity to each other on production/processing lines,\" Gregory P. Martin, a poultry extension educator for Penn State Extension, explains via email. \"Hand sanitizing and donning outerwear are normal practices in food processing plants, so additional personal protection equipment would be another layer of protection for the worker.\"\n\n\"It has been an adjustment for facilities to adjust, for example, to enact spacing, where possible and other precautions,\" Bucknavage says. \"We may be able to tell more after a few more weeks regarding supply chain issues.\"\n\n\"In order to keep production rolling with those added measures, many operations have simplified their product offerings, and this is one thing that is noticeable at the grocery store — less selection, for example and sizes,\" Bucknavage explains.",

This includes crimes not reported to the police, so it is an important alternative to police records. Victims do not report crime for various reasons, and without the BCS there would be no official source of information on these unreported crimes. Because members of the public are asked directly about their experiences, the survey also provides a consistent measure of crime that is unaffected by the extent to which crimes are reported to the police, or by changes in the criteria used by the police when recording crime. The survey also helps to identify those most at risk of different types of crime, and this helps in the planning of crime prevention programs. The BCS also examines people's attitudes to crime, such as how much they fear crime and what measures they take to avoid it. The survey also covers attitudes to the Criminal Justice System (CJS), including the police and the courts, and has also been successful at developing special measures to estimate the extent of domestic violence, stalking and sexual victimization, which are probably the least reported to the police, but among the most serious of crimes in their impact on victims.",

This work funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the HGCA will help farmers to increase yields, combating global food security and contributing to UK economic growth.\n\nTake-all disease, caused by the fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, reduces grain yield and quality and results in an increased amount of residual applied nitrogen fertiliser left in the soil post-harvest. Despite the use of chemical, biological and cultural control methods the take-all fungus is still one of the most difficult pathogens of wheat to control. The risk of take-all infection in second and third wheat crops is directly linked to the amount of fungus remaining in the soil after the first wheat is harvested.\n\nThe Rothamsted Research study, published in Plant Pathology, has demonstrated that wheat cultivars differ in their ability to build-up the take-all fungus.\n\nGrowing a low building cultivar, such as Cadenza, as a first wheat crop can be used to manipulate take-all inoculum levels in the soil resulting in better yields from the second and third wheat crops. Yield increases of up to 2 tonnes per hectare in 2nd wheats have been observed.",
    "answer": "Take-all disease, one of the most devastating fungal pathogen for wheat, reduces grain yield and quality in the UK where wheat is considered as an important staple crop and plays a significant role in the economy, and the problem is expected to be controlled by farmers through carefully selecting low building cultivars.",

For example, on October 14, 1492, Columbus wrote in his journal, \"with fifty men they can all be subjugated and made to do what is required of them.\" These were not mere words: after his second voyage, Columbus sent back a consignment of natives to be sold as slaves.\n\nYet in an April, 1493, letter to Luis de Santangel (a patron who helped fund the first voyage), Columbus made clear that the people he encountered had done nothing to deserve ill treatment.",

    "content": "In 1953 B.F. Skinner visited his daughter’s maths class. The Harvard psychologist found every pupil learning the same topic in the same way at the same speed. A few days later he built his first “teaching machine”, which let children tackle questions at their own pace. By the mid-1960s similar gizmos were being flogged by door-to-door salesmen. Within a few years, though, enthusiasm for them had fizzled out.\n\nSince then education technology (edtech) has repeated the cycle of hype and flop, even as computers have reshaped almost every other part of life. One reason is the conservatism of teachers and their unions. But another is that the brain-stretching potential of edtech has remained unproven.\n\nToday, however, Skinner’s heirs are forcing the sceptics to think again. Backed by billionaire techies such as Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, schools around the world are using new software to “personalise” learning. This could help hundreds of millions of children stuck in dismal classes—but only if edtech boosters can resist the temptation to revive harmful ideas about how children learn. To succeed, edtech must be at the service of teaching, not the other way around.\n\nThe conventional model of schooling emerged in Prussia in the 18th century. Alternatives have so far failed to teach as many children as efficiently. Classrooms, hierarchical year-groups, standardised curriculums and fixed timetables are still the norm for most of the world’s nearly 1.5bn school children.",

    "content": "It’s no mystery why so many people routinely skip breakfast: bad timing. It comes at a time when folks can be more occupied with matters of grooming, attire and otherwise making themselves presentable for a new day. However, studies conducted both in the United States and internationally have shown that skipping breakfast can affect learning, memory and physical well-being. Students who skip breakfast are not as efficient at selecting critical information for problem-solving as their peers who have had breakfast.\n\nFor schoolchildren, skipping breakfast diminishes the ability to recall and use newly acquired information, verbal fluency, and control of attention, according to Ernesto Pollitt, a UC Davis professor of pediatrics whose research focuses on the influence of breakfast on mental and physical performance. Skipping breakfast can impair thinking in adults, also. For both children and adults, a simple bowl of cereal with milk goes a long way toward providing a sufficiently nutritious start to the day. Green-Burgeson recommends choosing a cereal that’s low in sugar — less than five grams per serving — and using nonfat or one percent milk.\n\nFrederick Hirshburg, a pediatrician at UC Davis Medical Group, Carmichael, says that babies and other preschoolers rarely skip breakfast because “they’re usually the hungriest at the beginning of the day. Breakfast then becomes more of a “learned experience” than a response to a biological need, Hirshburg says.",
    "answer": "It is advised breakfast skippers including both adults and schoolchildren to have a simple breakfast to start the way, this is because skipping breakfast affects their mental and physical wellbeing by impairing thinking and problem skills, whereas pre-schoolers rarely skip breakfast as they are hungry in the morning so having breakfast can be easily made as part of their daily routine.",

The ancient Greeks used the word democracy to mean government by the many in contrast to government by the few. They key of democracy is that the people hold ultimate power. Abraham Lincoln best captured this spirit by describing democracy as a government of the people, by the people, for the people. Democratic government is opposed to an authoritative government, where the participation of its citizenry is limited or prohibited, and a state of anarchy where no form of government exists.\n\nOver the years there has been a dramatic growth in the number of political regimes that meet basic standards of procedural democracy. Such procedures include freedom of association and expression, competitive elections that determines who holds political power, and systematic constraints on the exercise of authority.\n\nThe establishment of democracy in countries with no prior democratic experience, its re-establishment in countries that had experienced periods of authoritarian rule, and the expansion in the number of independent states following the demise of European and Soviet communism led to the adoption of democracy in most countries. As a result of these changes, attention has been focused on constitutional rules that guide competition for and the exercise of political authority under democracy.",

The occupants in Columbus’s time were a group of Arawak Indians called Tainos who lived by farming, were organized into five chiefdoms, and numbered around half a million (the estimates range from 100,000 to 2,000,000). Columbus initially found them peaceful and friendly, until he and his Spaniards began mistreating them.\n\nUnfortunately for the Tainos, they had gold, which the Spanish coveted but didn’t want to go to the work of mining themselves. Hence the conquerors divided up the island and its Indian population among individual Spaniards, who put the Indians to work as virtual slaves, accidentally infected them with Eurasian diseases, and murdered them. By the year 1519, 27 years after Columbus’s arrival, that original population of half a million had been reduced to about 11,000, most of whom died that year of smallpox to bring the population down to 3,000.",

    "content": "Almost 120 years ago, during the first Gilded Age, sociologist Thorstein Veblen coined the term “conspicuous consumption”. He used it to refer to rich people flaunting their wealth through wasteful spending. Why buy a thousand-dollar suit when a hundred-dollar one serves the same function? The answer, Veblen said, was power. The rich asserted their dominance by showing how much money they could burn on things they didn’t need.\n\nWhile radical at the time, Veblen’s observation seems obvious now. In the intervening decades, conspicuous consumption has become deeply embedded in the texture of American capitalism. Our new Gilded Age is even more Veblenian than the last. Today’s captains of industry publicize their social position with private islands and superyachts while the president of the United States covers nearly everything he owns in gold.\n\nBut the acquisition of insanely expensive commodities isn’t the only way that modern elites project power. More recently, another form of status display has emerged. In the new Gilded Age, identifying oneself as a member of the ruling class doesn’t just require conspicuous consumption. It requires conspicuous production.\n\nIf conspicuous consumption involves the worship of luxury, conspicuous production involves the worship of labor. It isn’t about how much you spend. It’s about how hard you work. Nowhere is the cult of conspicuous production more visible than among America’s CEOs.",

    "content": "Since the dawn of recorded civilization, stars played a key role in religion and proved vital to navigation, according to the International Astronomical Union Astronomy, the study of the heavens, may be the most ancient of the sciences. The invention of the telescope and the discovery of the laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century prompted the realization that stars were just like the sun, all obeying the same laws of physics. In the 19th century, photography and spectroscopy — the study of the wavelengths of light that objects emit — made it possible to investigate the compositions and motions of stars from afar, leading to the development of astrophysics.\n\nA star develops from a giant, slowly rotating cloud that is made up entirely or almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. Due to its own gravitational pull, the cloud begins to collapse inward, and as it shrinks, it spins more and more quickly, with the outer parts becoming a disk while the innermost parts become a roughly spherical clump. \n\nAccording to NASA, this collapsing material grows hotter and denser, forming a ball-shaped protostar. When the heat in the protostar reaches about 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit (1 million degrees Celsius), atomic nuclei that normally repel each other start fusing together, and the star ignites. Nuclear fusion converts a small amount of the mass of these atoms into extraordinary amounts of energy — for instance, 1 gram of mass converted entirely to energy would be equal to an explosion of roughly 22,000 tons of TNT.\n\nThe life cycles of stars follow patterns based mostly on their initial mass. These include intermediate-mass stars such as the sun, with half to eight times the mass of the sun, high-mass stars that are more than eight solar masses, and low-mass stars a tenth to half a solar mass in size. The greater a star's mass, the shorter its lifespan generally is, according to NASA. Objects smaller than a tenth of a solar mass do not have enough gravitational pull to ignite nuclear fusion — some might become failed stars known as brown dwarfs.",

Global communication is \"shrinking\" the world, and global ageing is \"maturing\" it. The increasing presence of older persons in the world is making people of all ages more aware that we live in a diverse and multigenerational society. It is no longer possible to ignore ageing, regardless of whether one views it positively or negatively.\n\nDemographers note that if current trends in ageing continue as predicted, a demographic revolution, wherein the proportions of the young and the old will undergo a historic crossover, will be felt in just three generations. This portrait of change in the world's population parallels the magnitude of the industrial revolution: traditionally considered the most significant social and economic breakthrough in the history of humankind since the Neolithic period. It marked the beginning of a sustained movement towards modern economic growth in much the same way that globalization is today marking an unprecedented and sustained movement toward a \"global culture\". The demographic revolution, it is envisaged, will be at least as powerful.\n\nWhile the future effects are not known, a likely scenario is one where both the challenges as well as the opportunities will emerge from a vessel into which exploration and research, dialogue and debate are poured. Challenges arise as social and economic structures try to adjust to the simultaneous phenomenon of diminishing young cohorts with rising older ones, and opportunities present themselves in the sheer number of older individuals and the vast resources societies stand to gain from their contribution.\n\nThis ageing of the population permeates all social, economic and cultural spheres. Revolutionary change calls for new, revolutionary thinking, which can position policy formulation and implementation on sounder footing. In our ageing world, new thinking requires that we view ageing as a lifelong and older person.",

They are not capable of striving towards truth; they simply absorb information, and behave in ways useful for their survival.

No animal is capable of asking questions or generating problems that are irrelevant to its immediate circumstances or its evolutionarily designed needs.

When a swallow flies south, it doesn't wonder why it is hotter in Africa or what would happen if it flew still further south.\n\nHumans do ask themselves these and many other kinds of questions, questions that have no relevance, indeed make little sense, in the context of evolved needs and goals. What marks out humans is our capacity to go beyond our naturally defined goals such as the need to find food, shelter or a mate and to establish human created goals.\n\nSome contemporary thinkers believe that there are indeed certain questions that humans are incapable of answering because of our evolved nature.

The differences are apparent not only in school, from kindergarten to college, but also in the most ordinary circumstances: in the words people use and comprehend, in their differing abilities to read a map or follow directions, or in their capacities for remembering telephone numbers or figuring change. The variations in these specific skills are so common that they are often taken for granted. Yet what makes people so different?\n\nIt would be reasonable to think that the environment is the source of differences in cognitive skills—that we are what we learn. It is clear, for example, that human beings are not born with a full vocabulary; they have to learn words. Hence, learning must be the mechanism by which differences in vocabulary arise among individuals. And differences in experience—say, in the extent to which parents model and encourage vocabulary skills or in the quality of language training provided by schools—must be responsible for individual differences in learning.\n\nEarlier in this century psychology was in fact dominated by environmental explanations for variance in cognitive abilities. More recently, however, most psychologists have begun to embrace a more balanced view: one in which nature and nurture interact in cognitive development. During the past few decades, studies in genetics have pointed to a substantial role for heredity in molding the components of intellect, and researchers have even begun to track down the genes involved in cognitive function. These findings do not refute the notion that environmental factors shape the learning process. Instead they suggest that differences in people’s genes affect how easily they learn. ",

    "content": "According to researchers, the invisibility cloak illusion stems from the belief that we are much more socially observant than the people around us. This means that, while we watch and wonder about other people as much as possible, we often think that people around us are less aware. This illusion occurs because, while we are fully aware of our own impressions and speculations about other people, we have no idea about what those other people are thinking unless they choose to share with us, something that rarely happens except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nTo better understand what is happening, it is important to consider the ground-breaking research by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman on cognitive biases. When people make judgments about other people in social situations, they often depend on specific biases such as the availability heuristic, i.e., that we attach more significance to thoughts that come to mind easily. This is why we consider thoughts about other people as being more important than thoughts about inanimate objects. And so, as we look around us, we tend to focus our thoughts on the people we see and what they happen to be doing. Which is why people-watching can be so addictive.\n\nWhat adds to the sense that we are relatively invisible to others is that people tend to be as discreet as possible about their people-watching. Just because other people aren't sharing their observations with us, it's easy to pretend that they are not as observant as we are. Of course, people may share their people-watching observations with anyone they happen to be with but, for the most part, that only applies to something remarkable enough to comment on.

    "content": "Gardeners can feed their families and enrich the soil by growing legumes, such as green beans, soybeans, lentils and peas. Legume roots produce their own nitrogen, which is a major fertilizer nutrient needed by all plants for growth. Nitrogen is produced in nodules that form on the roots of legumes, which contain Rhizobium bacteria. The bacteria take nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form the plants can use. When legumes are pulled up in the fall, excess nitrogen from the nodules is left in the soil. The excess organic nitrogen can be used by other plants the following growing season. It's considered organic nitrogen because it was produced naturally, making green beans or peas great rotational crops in an organic crop production system. Organic growers prefer organic nitrogen because of its natural origins and because it breaks down slowly in the soil, thus slowly feeding plants throughout the growing season. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers tend to release nitrogen quickly and are harsher on the environment. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are generally applied in split applications during the season to mimic the slow release of organic nitrogen sources. Each specific legume generally requires a specific type of Rhizobium bacteria to produce nodules on their roots. Gardeners who have never grown green beans before can purchase small bags of inoculum or bacteria from most popular vegetable seed catalogs. \n\nBefore planting beans, open the package and pour in the dust-like bacteria among the seed. Shake the package and then plant. Nodules will form on the roots as they develop. The bacteria will remain in the soil, making it unnecessary to inoculate the seed next year. Do not apply extra nitrogen fertilizer to bean crops. Doing so makes bacteria in the nodules lazy, encouraging them to stop producing their own nitrogen. Legumes that are particularly popular in the home vegetable garden include lima beans, peas, edible soybeans, lentils and fava beans. In a recent survey, 44 percent of gardeners trained through New Mexico State University's Master Gardener Program said they grew green beans and other legumes in their home gardens. When planting, be sure to purchase appropriate strains of Rhizobium bacteria for each type of legume.",

    "content": "The Home Office s periodic British Crime Survey estimates that the true level of crime (the sorts, anyway, which inform the official figures) is about four times that which is registered in the annual statistics.\n\nQuite often, especially in the financial services sector, businesses do not report crimes against themselves for fear of lowering their public image. Many citizens today are not insured against car theft or property loss (because they cannot afford the premiums) so they have no incentive to tell the police if they become victims.\nA steep statistical rise in crime can sometimes arise not from a real growth in a particular type of conduct but from a new policing policy - offences of \"lewd dancing\" rose by about 300 per cent during 12 months in the 1980s in Manchester, but only because the zealous Chief Constable James Anderton had deployed a great many officers in gay night clubs.\n\nSometimes the enactment of a new range of offences or the possibility of committing old offences in a new way (like computer offences involving fraud and deception) can cause an upward jolt in crime levels. The figures just released show a startling jump in street robbery but much of this seems to be a very particular crime: the theft of the now ubiquitous mobile phones.\n\nConversely, if crimes like joyriding and some assaults are kept out of the categories measured in the annual statistics, as is the case, the official figures do not reflect even what is reported to the police as criminal.\n\nThe way that criminal statistics are compiled by the Home Office is also relevant. From April 1998, police forces started to count crime in a way which, according to the government, will give \"a more robust statistical measure\".\n\nUnder the new rules, crime is recorded as one crime per victim. Some crimes, like assaults, have always been recorded in this way, so the main impact of the change will be in the area of property offences. Shop thefts, for example, were the old rules counted offenders, will now count victims. Multiple thefts from cars in a car park with a barrier were previously counted as one offence but are now counted as separate offences.",

These animals weigh anywhere from 9 to 29 pounds, and they’re about 2 feet tall. While they do have a close resemblance to small bear cubs, koalas aren’t bears at all. Koalas are actually marsupials and are more closely related to Australia’s kangaroos and wombats. Marsupials have pouches to carry their offspring during early development stages. A baby koala, also known as a joey, is born blind and earless. It grows in the mother’s pouch for about six months. After that, the joey rides around on its mother’s back for another six months, using its mothers pouch to continue to feed during this time. Joeys are completely blind at birth, and their eyesight doesn’t improve too much as they mature. Overall, koalas have poor vision. They aren’t entirely blind, but their long-range sight is low. Because of this, these marsupials rely more on other senses to navigate their daily lives. To compensate for their eyesight, koalas have incredible hearing, which helps them stay ahead of predators and other koalas. They also have a great sense of smell they use to find food and detect koalas nearby. Interestingly, male koalas have scent glands on their chests that they use to mark trees and attract mates. They rub their chests up and down trees, which releases a strong, musky oil to mark their territory.",

    "content": "When people start thinking about language, the first question which often occurs to them is this: is language natural to humans? - in the same way that grunting is natural to pigs, and barking comes naturally to dogs. Or is it just something we happen to have learned? - in the same way that dogs may learn to beg, or elephants may learn to waltz, or humans may learn to play the guitar.\n\nClearly, in one sense, children 'learn' whatever language they are exposed to, be it Chinese, Nootka or English. So no one would deny that 'learning' is very important. But the crucial question is whether children are born with 'blank sheets' in their head as far as language is concerned - or whether humans are 'programmed' with an outline knowledge of the structure of languages in general.\n\nThis question of whether language is partly due to nature or wholly due to learning or nurture is often referred to as the nature-nurture controversy, and has been discussed for centuries. For example, it was the topic of one of Plato's dialogues, the Cratylus. Controversies which have been going on for literally ages tend to behave in a characteristic fashion. They lie dormant for a while, then break out fiercely. This particular issue resurfaced in linguistics in 1959 when the linguist Noam Chomsky wrote a devastating and witty review of Verbal Behavior, a book by the Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner (Skinner 1957; Chomsky 1959). This book claimed to 'explain' language as a set of habits gradually built up over the years. According to Skinner, no complicated innate or mental mechanisms are needed. All that is necessary is the systematic observation of the events in the external world which prompt the speaker to utter sounds.",

He explained: “The quantity of nutritious vegetable matter consumed in fattening the carcass of an ox would afford 10 times the sustenance if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth.”\n\nTwo hundred years later, mainstream agronomists and dietitians have caught up with the poet. A growing scientific consensus agrees that feeding cereals and beans to animals is an inefficient and extravagant way to produce human food, that there is a limited amount of grazing land, that the world will be hard-pressed to supply a predicted population of 9 billion people with a diet as rich in meat as the industrialised world currently enjoys, and that it’s not a very healthy diet anyway. On top of this, livestock contribute significantly towards global warming, generating 14.5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions, according to one much-quoted estimate from the United Nations.\n\nNow that the problem has been identified, the challenge is to persuade people in wealthy countries to eat less meat.

    "content": "The booksellers of Hookham and carpenter (hereafter referred to only as ‘Hookham’) were located on New Bond Street in London, and their records span the most politically turbulent decade of the eighteenth-century—the 1790s. Clients who frequented Hookham were primarily from the aristocratic or gentry classes. In fact, of Hookham’s total buyers, 22% were aristocracy and 35% of the aristocracy purchased novels. We can also confidently assume that untitled female customers were of gentry income, because their addresses were primarily in London’s fashionable ‘West End’.\n\nHookham’s ledgers not only reveal a dramatic increase in the proportion of female purchasers of novels by comparison to earlier studies of provincial women, but they also reveal a remarkable increase in the proportion of female purchases of novels authored by females. Such a marked increase illustrates that Hookham’s leisured female customers were able to buy more novels. Furthermore, the fact that these female aristocrats and gentry have accounts under their own name, not their husbands’, demonstrates the greater degree of agency and independence that these urban, moneyed women had relative to provincial women. However, because our study does not include an examination of male customers, we are very limited in what claims we can make about whether or not these women behaved according to the cliché that women were the predominant consumers of novels in the eighteenth-century.\n\nMoreover, while more disposable income and leisure time certainly accounts for the significant increase in female purchases of novels authored by women in the 1790s, this increase also strongly suggests a desire on the part of women readers to engage in this politically charged decade. Thus, novel-reading provided women readers with the means through which they were able to participate in the male-dominated world of politics. The latter part of our paper will more fully explore this hypothesis in the context of certain recent literary scholars’ claims that both Gothic and sentimental novels are actively engaged in political debate and discussion.",

These rivers in the sky can transport 15 times the volume of the Mississippi River. When that moisture reaches the coast and moves inland, it rises over the mountains, generating rain and snow. Many fire-weary westerners welcome these deluges, but atmospheric rivers can trigger other disasters, such as extreme flooding and debris flows. \n\nAtmospheric rivers occur globally, affecting the west coasts of the world’s major land masses, including Portugal, Western Europe, Chile and South Africa. For example, so-called “Pineapple Express” storms that carry moisture from Hawaii to the U.S. Events like these have drawn attention in recent years, but atmospheric rivers are not new. \n\nIn the past 20 years, as observation networks have improved, scientists have learned more about these important weather phenomena. In dry conditions, atmospheric rivers can replenish water supplies and quench dangerous wildfires. But in wet conditions, they can cause damaging floods and debris flows, wreaking havoc on local economies. Like hurricanes, atmospheric rivers are projected to grow longer, wider and wetter in a warming climate. All these are the reflect of climate change. Scientists believe that improving atmospheric forecasting systems should be a priority for adapting to a changing climate, which can give valuable information of atmospheric rivers’ intensity, duration and landfall locations to residents and emergency responders, because stabilizing the global climate system is the only long-term way to minimize economic damage and risk to vulnerable communities.

Since the Americas were already populated when he arrived at least one group of people had beaten him there. Archaeological evidence shows that several Viking expeditions reached North America and there are fringe theories of other Pre-Columbus visits to America.\n\nColumbus’s trip to America is often claimed as a voyage of discovery. In many senses it was, but it was not the first trip to the Americas nor even the first European expedition.\n\nHumans first crossed to the Americas from Asia during the last Ice Age. About 30,000 years ago a land bridge existed between Siberia and Alaska. These people can certainly be said to have discovered America quite some time before Columbus. But if you wish to overlook them, and they so often are, there were other discoverers of America.\n\nThe Icelandic Sagas talk of expeditions to the West which reached two landing sites- one called Greenland and one called Vinland. Greenland can be easily identified as the country we now call Greenland. But it was thought that visits to Vinland were mythical.\n\nIn 1960 at a place called Laux Meadows in Newfoundland the remains of a Viking settlement were discovered.

    "content": "Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression related to changes in seasons, is a compelling example of the complex relationship between our biological rhythms and mental health. Predominantly occurring in the winter months, SAD is characterized by symptoms such as low mood, lethargy, and a loss of interest in everyday activities. Biologically, SAD is linked to the reduced exposure to sunlight during shorter winter days. This decrease in sunlight can disrupt our body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, which regulates sleep, hormone production, and mood. The lack of light can also lead to lower serotonin levels, a neurotransmitter associated with mood regulation, and an increase in melatonin production, which can induce sleepiness and affect mood. Interestingly, not everyone is affected by SAD in the same way, suggesting that genetic factors may also play a role. Some individuals may have a predisposition to the disorder, making them more susceptible to changes in light and seasonal shifts. Treatment for SAD often includes light therapy, which involves exposure to artificial light that mimics natural outdoor light, helping to regulate the circadian rhythm. Other approaches include psychotherapy, medications, and lifestyle changes such as increasing physical activity and spending more time outdoors. Recognizing the symptoms of SAD is crucial for timely intervention. It is important to distinguish between a simple 'winter blues' and the more severe symptoms of SAD that impact daily functioning. Awareness and understanding of this disorder can lead to better management and improved mental health during the challenging winter months. In conclusion, Seasonal Affective Disorder exemplifies the intricate connection between environmental factors, our biological systems, and mental health. By acknowledging and addressing the unique challenges of SAD, we can better support those affected and enhance our overall approach to mental well-being.",

But in 1609, the instrument, which had been invented only the year before by Dutch opticians, was known as a \"spyglass,\" in anticipation of its military uses. The device was also sold as a toy. When Galileo read of it, he quickly set about making a much more powerful version. The Dutch telescopes magnified images by 3 times; Galileo's telescopes magnified them by 8 to 30 times.\n\nAt the time, astronomy, like much of science, remained under the spell of Aristotle. Almost 2,000 years after his death, the giant of Greek philosophy was held in such high regard that even his most suspect pronouncements were considered unimpeachable. Aristotle had maintained that all celestial objects were perfect and immutable spheres, and that the stars made a dizzying daily journey around the center of the universe, our stationary Earth. Why scrutinize the sky? The system had already been neatly laid out in books. Astronomers \"wish never to raise their eyes from those pages,\" Galileo wrote in frustration, \"as if this great book of the universe had been written to be read by nobody but Aristotle, and his eyes had been destined to see for all posterity.\"\n\nIn Galileo's day, the study of astronomy was used to maintain and reform the calendar. Sufficiently advanced students of astronomy made horoscopes; the alignment of the stars was believed to influence everything from politics to health.",

    "content": "The evolution of the RAS (Royal Agricultural Society) fits into the wider Western trend of promoting nationalism, progress and technology through exhibitory venues, which first became popular in the 1850s. Various types of fairs, from local agricultural shows to Worlds Fairs, were used as instruments of hegemony to support imperialism, to promote burgeoning capitalist endeavors, and to shape class identities, social spaces and public spaces Visual culture and the art of display became essential in defining aspects of national distinction. Colonial nations in particular, such as Canada and Australia, were attempting to develop distinct national identities to differentiate themselves from British imperial power. Agricultural fairs in North America originated at the beginning of the nineteenth century and were devoted to educating practicing framers in ways of improving their cultivation of livestock and crops through the use of various technologies.\n\nSymbolically, this cultivation was linked to the colonial project of civilizing wilderness frontiers. By the mid-twentieth century, advertisement in various forms was common and included programs or brochures, which were handed out to fair-goers as they entered. These were seen as opportunities for educating the public. Often comments promoting the importance of the fair were based on ideas about patriotism and nationalism. The Royal Easter Show is a good example of an exhibitory context which grew from a small fair, based on local agricultural competition, to a larger venue that incorporated the mandates of national development and the cultivation of colonial character.\n\nIn 1822, the RAS was created on the premise that was a dire need in Australia for the development of improved farming skills to better support growing urban populations and export markets. Organizations based on agricultural improvement, which were popular in Britain, provided camaraderie as well as political and financial support for their members. Once transferred to the colonies, in this case Australia, they played an integral part in converting and organizing land for colonial purposes.",

    "content": "It was once assumed that all living things could be divided into two fundamental and exhaustive categories. Multicellular plants and animals, as well as many unicellular organisms, are eukaryotic—their large, complex cells have a well-formed nucleus and many organelles. On the other hand, the true bacteria are prokaryotic cells, which are simple and lack a nucleus. The distinction between eukaryotes and bacteria, initially defined in terms of subcellular structures visible with a microscope, was ultimately carried to the molecular level. Here prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have many features in common. For instance, they translate genetic information into proteins according to the same type of genetic coding. But even where the molecular processes are the same, the details in the two forms are different and characteristic of the respective forms. For example, the amino acid sequences of various enzymes tend to be typically prokaryotic or eukaryotic.\n\nThe differences between the groups and the similarities within each group made it seem certain to most biologists that the tree of life had only two stems. Moreover, arguments pointing out the extent of both structural and functional differences between eukaryotes and true bacteria convinced many biologists that the precursors of the eukaryotes must have diverged from the common ancestor before the bacteria arose.\n\nAlthough much of this picture has been sustained by more recent research, it seems fundamentally wrong in one respect. Among the bacteria, there are organisms that are significantly different both from the cells of eukaryotes and from the true bacteria, and it now appears that there are three stems in the tree of life. New techniques for determining the molecular sequence of the RNA of organisms have produced evolutionary information about the degree to which organisms are related, the time since they diverged from a common ancestor, and the reconstruction of ancestral versions of genes. These techniques have strongly suggested that although the true bacteria indeed form a large coherent group, certain other bacteria, the archaebacteria, which are also prokaryotes and which resemble true bacteria, represent a distinct evolutionary branch that far antedates the common ancestor of all true bacteria.",

Reticulated pythons, for example, will swim between islands along the coasts of southeastern Asia, crossing distances that could wear out an Olympic gold medalist. That doesn't, however, make them sea snakes. When naturalists talk about \"sea snakes,\" they're usually referring to two very specific groups of reptiles that are part of the cobra family: true sea snakes and sea kraits. We've already met one of the former species. Yellow-bellied sea snakes, those oddball knot-tiers, are classic hydrophiids. True sea snakes like these have sworn off dry land altogether. Fully marine, they give birth to live young at sea. Scientists recently learned that Australia's Cleveland Bay is a biological nursery where pregnant spine-bellied sea snakes come to deliver their broods. Terrestrial births just aren't an option. Hydrophiids never exit the water voluntarily because they lack the wide belly scales other snakes use to crawl over solid ground. Drop one on a beach and the poor creature will struggle to move under its own power. Sea kraits are a bit less streamlined, but they're more competent on land. They mate, shed and digest some of their meals outside the water. Equipped with the requisite belly scales, the animals are free to hit the turf, and like sea turtles, they lay eggs in beachside nests.",

Their reaction times and brain activity were closely monitored with the use of functional MRI scans. On the first part, which was recognizing the geometric objects, results reveal that the subjects’ performance didn’t show any dissimilarities, which implied that the experts’ visualization skills are no better than the amateurs’. However, during the identification of the chess positions, the experts were seen to have performed significantly faster and better.\n\nAs the researchers geared toward an element of a study previously conducted on pattern and object recognition by the chess experts, they had anticipated to notice areas of the left hemisphere of the experts’ brains (involved in object recognition) to be more reactive when they performed the tasks. However, the reaction times of the subjects were virtually identical. The very thing that sets the experts apart from the amateurs is that the former’s right brain hemispheres (involved in pattern recognition) were to seen to have also lit up during the activity. Therefore, both sides of the experts’ brains were active, processing information in two places simultaneously. The researchers added that when they showed the chess diagrams to the subjects, they observed that the amateurs relied on looking at the pieces intently to be able to recognize them, whereas the experts merely relied on their peripheral vision and looked across the boards.",

    "content": "With the rise of indigenous rights movements and the emergence of post-colonial nations the acquisition and ownership of human remains became a divisive and politically loaded issue. It became increasingly clear that many human remains in museum collections around the world represented the traces of colonial exploitation and discredited pseudo-scientific theories of race. In the light of these debates and changing attitudes, some human remains were returned or repatriated to their communities of origin, a process which continues to this day. Recently a new set of challenges to the study of human remains has emerged from a rather unexpected direction: the British government revised its interpretation of nineteenth-century burial legislation in a way that would drastically curtail the ability of archaeologists to study human remains of any age excavated in England and Wales. This paper examines these extraordinary events and the legal, political and ethical questions that they raise.\n\nIn April 2008 the British government announced that, henceforth, all human remains archaeologically excavated in England and Wales should be reburied after a two-year period of scientific analysis. Not only would internationally important pre-historic remains have to be returned to the ground, removing them from public view, but also there would no longer be any possibility of long-term scientific investigation as new techniques and methods emerged and developed in the future. Thus, while faunal remains, potsherds, artefacts and environmental samples could be analysed and re-analysed in future years, human remains were to be effectively removed from the curation process. Archaeologists and other scientists were also concerned that this might be the first step towards a policy of reburying all human remains held in museum collections in England and Wales including prehistoric, Roman, Saxon, Viking and Medieval as well as more recent remains.",

    "content": "When Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time.\n\nCurriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in students’ social backgrounds because the ‘new’ offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point.\n\nThe need to improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose, since the demand for high-level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low-skilled are diminishing.\n\nImproved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.",
    "answer": "The idea of improving the quality of education is widespread throughout OECD countries as they strive to strengthen human capital to support their economies, but Australian curriculum failed to improve equity as its education system tend to separate individuals and groups by their social backgrounds, which weakens the capacity of schools to build social cohesion.",

They are all perfectly pleasant, but great? The first question to tackle is the difference between liveability and greatness. Perhaps we cannot aspire to make a great city, but if we attempt to make a liveable one, can it in time become great?\n\nThere are some fundamental elements that you need. The first is public space. Whether it is Vienna’s Ringstrasse and Prater park, or the beaches of Melbourne and Vancouver, these are places that allow the city to pause and the citizens to mingle and to breathe, regardless of class or wealth.

    "content": "True to its name, a single-use plastic is disposable plastic that's designed to be used once then tossed or recycled. This includes everything from plastic water drink bottles and produce bags to disposable plastic razors and plastic ribbon: really any plastic item you use then immediately discard. While these items can be recyclable, Megean Weldon of the blog and waste-prevention shop Zero Waste Nerd says that's hardly the norm.\n\n\"In reality, very few plastic items can be processed into new materials and products,\" she says in an email. \"Unlike glass and aluminum, plastic isn't processed into the same item it was when it was collected by a recycling center. The quality of plastic is downgraded, so eventually, and inevitably, that plastic will still end up in a landfill.\"\n\nMost bottles say they can be recycled, and based solely on their easily recyclable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) composition, they could be. However, nearly seven out of 10 bottles end up in landfills or tossed as litter. This problem increased when China decided to stop accepting and recycling plastic in 2018. For municipalities, that meant recycling became significantly pricier, according to The Atlantic, so many municipalities are now simply opting for the budget-friendly landfill over recycling.\n\nPair this landfill-first approach with the world's ever-growing plastic consumption — humans produce almost 20,000 plastic bottles per second, according to The Guardian and America's waste grew by 4.5 percent from 2010 to 2015 — it's no wonder the world is overflowing with plastic waste.",
    "answer": "Single-use plastics, intended for one-time use, often fail to be effectively recycled due to limitations in plastic processing and declining recycling rates, leading to significant plastic waste accumulation, further exacerbated by China's discontinuation of plastic recycling, contributing to a global plastic waste problem.",

    "content": "The shipping container is one of the mainstays of international trade. The globalised modern economy depends on the rapid and efficient movement of goods that containerisation allows. In many ways it was the advent of the container that allowed this globalised economy to develop.\n\nInvented during World War two as an efficient method of moving equipment to the front lines, there are now at any one time up to 15 million containers being used to transport goods on land and sea or waiting to be filled at factories and ports. They are vital in the supply chain and have allowed the added efficiency of \"just in time\" inventory management, where companies no longer keep large warehouses of stock or parts, but rely on the ability to quickly order what they want from their suppliers. It is estimated that since the 1980s the ratio of inventory to GDP in American businesses has fallen from 25% to 15%. Altogether total business inventory in the US is estimated at $1.5 trillion, without \"just in time\" management methods this might be as much as $2.5 trillion.\n\nThis means that companies rely more and more on the prompt delivery of parts from their suppliers to fulfill orders. This is particularly true of industries such as computer manufacture, which no longer make all the parts of the products that bear their names, but instead out source, often to suppliers half way around the world. American computer manufacturers are, for example, increasingly dependent on Asian microchip manufacturers in countries such as Taiwan and Thailand.",
    "answer": "Shipping containers have improved efficacy of inventory management and reduce inventory spending significantly within America, which enable companies to provide prompt delivery from suppliers to fulfil orders and outsource the production to overseas manufacturers.",

    "content": "For centuries, the isolated, Indigenous people of North Sentinel Island (known as the Sentinelese) have rejected all attempts by the outside world to infiltrate their tiny tropical home in the Bay of Bengal. In fact, anthropologists have no idea how many Sentinelese live on the island: estimates vary between 50 and 500. North Sentinel Island is part of a much larger island chain called the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, currently governed by India. There are 184 islands in this tropical archipelago located in the Bay of Bengal about 300 miles off the coast of Myanmar and 700 miles from India. Only about 30 of the islands in the chain are inhabited and are home to Indigenous people like the Onge and the Jarawa, who speak different languages than the Sentinelese. In the 18th century, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were first explored by Dutch, Austrian and British merchant ships looking for the best trade routes to the spice-rich Asian subcontinent. In 1771, a ship with the British East India Company was the first to spot signs of life on North Sentinel Island, cooking fires flickering in the night. The first permanent European settlers arrived in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the 1850s when the British built a penal colony on Grand Andaman Island, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from North Sentinel Island, to house colonial prisoners from British-ruled India. In 1896, a prisoner tried to escape on a raft and washed up on the beach of North Sentinel Island. A search party found him a few days later, dead from multiple arrows.",

This includes all knowledge that is available before the learning event, and which has been gathered or developed by any means, and in any situation, including both formal and, quite often, informal learning situations. Learners need enough previous knowledge and understanding to enable them to learn new things; they also need help making links with new and previous knowledge explicit. \n\nIt is considered to be valuable to go through a process of what has been called 'activating prior knowledge'. Teachers often go through this process at the beginning of a new topic. They also use introductory strategies at the beginning of lessons which are continuations from previous lessons. In terms of the practicalities of teaching, this is a process of making children think about the topic or remember what has been covered already. In terms of theory, it is to do with activating particular schemas.",

    "content": "Coffee is enjoyed by millions of people every day and the 'coffee experience' has become a staple of our modern life and culture. While the current body of research related to the effects of coffee consumption on human health has been contradictory, a study in the June issue of Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety, which is published by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), found that the potential benefits of moderate coffee drinking outweigh the risks in adult consumers for the majority of major health outcomes considered.\n\nResearchers at Ulster University systematically reviewed 1,277 studies from 1970 to-date on coffee's effect on human health and found the general scientific consensus is that regular, moderate coffee drinking (defined as 3-4 cups per day) essentially has a neutral effect on health, or can be mildly beneficial.\n\nThe authors noted causality of risks and benefits cannot be established for either with the research currently available as they are largely based on observational data. Further research is needed to quantify the risk-benefit balance for coffee consumption, as well as identify which of coffee's many active ingredients, or indeed the combination of such, that could be inducing these health benefits.",
    "answer": "Despite the fact that a recent study shows that moderate coffee consumption can be beneficial on health which also has been proved by historical studies, further research is still needed to validate the drawbacks and benefits of coffee drinking as healthy compounds within coffee remain to be identified.",

    "content": "Robots manning a space station might read like science fiction, but this could be a reality sooner than later. NASA has already been testing robots called ‘Astrobee’, which work on the International Space Station (ISS). These three cube-shaped free-flying robots began working independently alongside astronauts on the space station.\n\nOne reason why robots will be critical to future space station missions is that these stations will be located at quite a distance from Earth. For context, ISS orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 400 kilometres above the surface of Earth where distance in communication is not an issue. But in contrast, NASA’s proposed Gateway space station will orbit the Moon, which is an average of 384,400 kilometres away from our planet. In such scenarios, robots could solve many of the problems.\n\nBut getting the robots to work in space is not so easy – even though they might work perfectly fine in the labs as NASA’s experience with Astrobee showed. “The environment on ISS is pretty dynamic. Things change day to day with bags moving, and lighting conditions changing. This made it difficult for the robot to navigate the environment. We had to redesign a lot of the software and algorithms that go into this vision-based navigation and ultimately, we got it right,” said Jose Benavides, project manager for the Astrobee project at NASA.
