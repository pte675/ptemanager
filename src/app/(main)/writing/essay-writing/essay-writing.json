    "content": "Large shopping malls are replacing small shops. What is your opinion about this? Discuss with appropriate examples.",
    "answer": "Nowadays, the rise of shopping malls has been major trends in retailing and they are slowly replacing small shops, which has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be agreed that consumers can reap more benefit from shopping malls, while on the other hand stands a perspective that the decline of small businesses are detrimental for local economy. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why big shopping malls seem to be more attractive to customers, and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that shopping malls can offer a whole variety of products and competitive price. For example, Chadstone is one of the most popular shopping malls located in Melbourne and gathers a collection of retailers, restaurants, as well as entertainments, which is more likely to satisfy the various demand of customers comparing to independent business. Thus, there are certainly benefits occurring from the shopping at big malls.\n\nNevertheless, there remain some drawbacks for the death of small shops and the most alarming one is the economic reason. As an illustration, small shops stimulate local economic growth as they usually source products or materials within local areas, comparing to big shopping malls which are more profit driven and prone to get competitive deals from overseas suppliers. Thus, the disappearance of small independent retailers can cause serious economic problems within local areas and challenge local supply chains.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the impact of big shopping malls is prominent, although the way it disadvantages local economy should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "For a successful company, selling products depends more on company's reputation or it depends more on if they provide discount and free offers. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "answer": "Nowadays, the important for adopting various methods for selling products, which attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be said that the reputation of a company is crucial to sustain profits in the long term, while on the other hand stands a perspective that discount and offers cam attract a higher number of customers. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why company’s reputation is important for company’s success, and the most conspicuous one steams from the fact that it helps to cultivate customer loyalty by which the consumer is more convinced to buy a product of a previously established brand irrespectively. For instance, the reputation of a business can enable it to differentiate its product in highly competitive markets, allow it to have premium pricing, and become the ultimate factor for customers to patronize one business over another. Therefore, reputation of a company can retain customers on a long term basis.\n\nNevertheless, some people hold an opposing view and tend to believe that discounts and free offers help in attracting more customers, which increases the customer base and contributes to a lucrative business. For example, customers are inherently drawn towards products that are on discount and find them irresistible as they reckon they are getting better value for money. Hence, discounts and free offers help in accelerating the profits as well as attracting new customers.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the success of a company based on reputation of a company is prominent, although the way discounts and free offers increases the customer base should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "Many companies involve employees in decision making policy. Some people think that it is important for the progression of the company. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "answer": "In today’s business world, employees are encouraged to join in the decision-making process, which attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from working professionals. Most people would agree that it is important to bring employees onboard when making decision as it will directly lead to positive impact to the future direction of the company. This essay will elaborate the benefits and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why employees should participate in the decision-making and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that the policy created in this manner could potentially be more rounded and inclusive. This is because there are certain aspects of concern only can be drawn from employees’ perspective where management is likely to overlook. Moreover, when a company involves more minds, different ideas will be brought to light and solutions will be proposed that were never before thought of. Therefore, policies made with employees are generally more robust and sound.\n\nAnother key justification for upholding this notion is that involving employees in the decision making process would encourage innovation and stimulate creativity among the peers. A recent research published on Economist indicates that when company employees are given the opportunities to express themselves, the organisation itself usually will reap the most benefit from the surge of different views and innovative ideas, which could potentially translate to excellent policies to better shaping the company in multiple dimensions.\n\nOverall, it is agreed that employees are important asset to company, with their minds put in gear for the decision making, they will get the recognition they rightfully deserve while at the same time, the policies created can be both beneficial and productive.",

    "content": "In the past 100 years, there are many inventions such as antibiotics, airplanes and computer. What do you think is the most important inventions for the past 10 years? Why?",
    "answer": "Nowadays, whether the invention of the antibiotics, airplanes or the computer is the most important inventions in the past 100 years has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. Some people believe that the products of technological development such as the airplane and the computer are the most important inventions while others hold the view that the invention of the antibiotics is of greater progress, which also corresponds with my opinion due to humanistic reason.\n\nFirst and foremost, it has been argued that the technological reason is why many people believe that the airplane and the computer are greatest inventions. The industrial revolution resulted in the progress in many technological areas. The invention of airplane has made the people’s dream of flying like a bird come true and allowed people travelling to anywhere in the world while the invention of the computers has enormously promoted the working efficiency of the human beings, allowing accomplishing the tasks with just a click of button rather than taking years’ time several decades ago. The technological development has in many ways enormously enriched people’s lives.\n\nAlthough potentially positive impacts that the airplane and the computer bring to people’s lives, I still reckon antibiotics is a greater invention. Another factor should be considered is the humanistic reason, which in other words, the invention of the antibiotic has enabled the survival of the human beings that allows people owning the ability to make more progress in the technological development. Without the invention of the antibiotics, people would still suffer from many diseases caused by smallpox, viruses, and invisible bacteria, any of which could turn out to be fatal. Without the invention of the antibiotics, humans could not survive as long as nowadays and will not have the luxury to invent the airplane and computer, not even to able to enjoy the benefits that the airplane and computer created.\n\nIn conclusion, I hold the view that the antibiotics are the most important innovation among the three. To address this issue, the government, and the society should make a concerted effort to make more advancement in medical invention.",

    "answer": "Nowadays, the correlations between law and human behaviours, which attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be said that most people are psychologically manipulated by the law; additionally, it stands a perspective that laws form a second nature of human. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to a logical conclusion. \n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why laws have an influence on human behaviours and the most conspicuous one stems from psychological reasons. As an illustration, people are in fear of receiving any form of legal punishment, including fines, going to jail or death penalty. Furthermore, a recent research published on the Economist reveals that 90% of people stop smoking in the public after public smoking ban is introduced in Australia. Thus, in the fear of taking legal responsibility of crimes or wrongdoings, citizens are obliged to comply with the given law and regulations.\n\nAnother key justification for upholding this notion is that adhering to laws can change people behaviour patterns by forming a second nature. For instance, the implementation of a new traffic rule about fasten seatbelts, stirred a sense of extreme irritation at the initial phrase of legal practice. But now it has become a reasonably comfortable habit. Therefore, human behaviours can be positively influenced by external pressure and legislation. \n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the psychological impact of law on human behaviours is prominent, and the way legislation forms people’s second nature should not be overlooked.

    "content": "You need to study climate change. Which aspect of climate change will you choose and why? Use examples.",
    "answer": "Nowadays, climate change has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. Some people believe that it is important to learn the reasons causing climate change in order to reduce it while others hold the view that it is essential to reduce the consequences of climate change and help people to cope with the inevitable natural disasters in order to save people’s lives. In my opinion, I believe both aspects are important due to environmental and humanistic reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, it has been argued that the environmental reason is why I think it is important to learn. The factors causing climate change must be taken into account when thinking of studying climate change. I reckon that climate change has enormously harmed people’s lives in many ways. According to Scientific America 2014, it is reported that there were many factors including the increasing greenhouse gas emission and over-­exploited and burning of fossil fuels, contributing to climate change as these behaviours have released large amount of carbon dioxide, which results in the increase of the temperature of our earth and sea level leading to flood and river erosion.\n\nMoreover, another reason should be considered is the humanistic factor, which in other words, it is important to learn to reduce the impact of climate change to save people’s lives when facing a natural disaster such as floods. As far as society is concerned, the ultimate aim of sustainable development of our world is to strike a balance between human demand and nature capacity. For instance, a recent research published in The Scientist reveals that our society becomes more cautious after every disaster occurred by giving appropriate training and introducing technologies to help people to protect themselves, which dramatically lessen the impact of inevitable disasters.\n\nIn conclusion, I hold the view that it is important to learn the factors causing climate change and how to reduce the impact of it because of environmental and humanistic reasons.

    "content": "Do you think consumers should avoid over packaged products or is it the responsibility of producers?",
    "answer": "Over packaging is a clever tactic that many manufacturers employ to make their products look more attractive. Since consumers get drawn to beautifully packaged items, over packaging may help sell more products. Some manufacturers also employ this technique to hide the flaws of their products. It is true that manufacturers have a responsibility to avoid over packaging. But in my opinion, they are unlikely to stop this practice until consumers stop buying over packaged products.\n\nOver packaging is not a benign practice. It does not help anyone except the manufacturer. Over packaging hurts the consumer and the environment. Wastefully packaged boxes take up a lot more space than necessary in shipping trucks. As a result, to carry the same amount of cargo, trucks have to make more trips. This results in the wastage of energy, materials and manpower.\n\nAll the materials used for packaging will eventually end up in landfills. This creates a serious problem for the environment. Over packaging may lead to deforestation, global warming and air pollution. Paper is still the most common material used for packaging. Each year tens of thousands of trees are being cut down to create packaging materials. Plastic is also used for packaging. The environmental impact of plastic is well-known. It is sad that companies still haven’t woken up to the dangers of over packaging and resort to such practices to sell their products.\n\nTo conclude, over packaging is not something that should be encouraged. While it might seem to be a benign practice, it has negative impacts on the environment. Consumers have to stop buying over packaged products. Only then will manufacturers take notice and stop shipping their items in large almost empty packets.",

    "content": "Many people think that regions affect successful people. What is your opinion about native regions and accomplished person’s influence on the region he belongs to?",
    "answer": "Many people argue that success of an individual depends upon the environment in which he or she has grown up. However, in my opinion, native place’s environment is only one factor but a person’s attitude, capability and determination also play a pivotal role in achieving success.\n\nNative environment plays a detrimental role in inculcating traits such as leadership, social skills etc. These qualities an individual acquires over a period of time. The behaviour of people in neighbourhood, school friends and college friends significantly affects behaviour and skills of a person. For instance, Barak Obama, the first black president, received most of his leadership skills from people with whom he spent his childhood time.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not only native environment that is responsible for development of an individual and his success. After an individual moves out from his native place to some other place for work he tends to learn new things that he was not aware about at his home place. Moving to other places introduces an individual to new ideas and new ways of doing things. It allows a person to do thing in a broad perspective and this open-minded thinking plays a vital role in a person’s success. For example, Jack Ma is a famous Chinese businessman achieved all his success only after leaving his hometown. While moving to different places he learnt different people and various skills, which he was not aware of at his native place. And these new learning helped him rule the business world.\n\nTo conclude, only native environment may not be behind an individual’s success. There are a lot of other factors that take an individual towards success. ",

    "content": "Climate change is a concerning global issue. Who should take the responsibilities, governments, big companies or individuals? ",
    "answer": "Recently scientists worried about climate change have urged governments to introduce measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are seen as its main cause. Simultaneously, politicians and environmentalists have urged individuals to make changes to their lifestyle. I shall argue that governments and individuals should take joint responsibility for this problem.\n\nFirstly, industry accounts for a large proportion of the greenhouse gas emissions, and this can only be controlled by government action. Measures could be taken to discourage pollution, such as limiting or taxing the use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, subsidies could be offered to industries to clean up their production processes. If these ideas were adopted, I believe that businesses would regard pollution as a financial issue.\n\nSecondly, only discussion between governments can ensure that solutions are successful. The Kyoto agreement, for example, tried to reach global agreement on how to address the problem. Without such co-operating, it seems to me that efforts to reduce fuel consumption are unlikely to be effective.\n\nHowever, national and international policies will only succeed if individuals also change their lifestyle. For example, people could think more carefully about how they use energy in their homes. By using less electricity, installing energy-efficient light bulbs and electrical appliances, or investing in solar panels, individuals can make a real difference. In addition, I think individual attitudes to transport need to change. Instead of making short tips by car, people could choose to walk, cycle, or take a bus. Since cars are a major source of the problem, changing our behaviour in this area would have a major impact.\n\nIn conclusion, I would maintain that only a combination of international agreement, national policies, and changes in individual behaviour would succeed in preventing further damage to the environment.

    "answer": "It is a true fact to consider that today's world has become a global village. Due to that reason business has to face huge competition to catch-up the highly competitive market. Considering this, there are some analysts who hold an opinion that in the company top management should consider employees’ suggestions before making the decisions while others consider that they should take decision on their own. This essay will assert both sides of the contentions deducing a reasonable conclusion. \n\nHigher authorities should consider employees suggestions or ideas before taking important decisions for the company. First and foremost, job experience could be a significant factor. It is generally seen that majority of the people working in the particular area have become experienced professionals with many practical knowledge that the management could use in their favour for decision-making. The engagement of employees in decision-making creates a very positive impression and inspires them to work better. This is also an effective measure to control the mutiny of the labour in an industry. \n\nThere are some groups who are in favour of the idea that management should not consider employees suggestions or ideas when they make decisions, in spite of views discussed above. Management responsibility could be a substantial reason behind the opponent's viewpoint. There are companies in which they believe that higher management are responsible to come up with best decision and innovation for better future, because they believe employees add ideas or suggestions for their personal interests. \n\nIn conclusion, undoubtedly, company managements have higher responsibility to take plausibility of implementation for the healthier future, but it cannot be denied that lower level worked force has immense experienced of their profession. Therefore, employees should not be neglected and their decision and feedback should always be included while taking any decision for the company.",

    "answer": "The popularity of extreme sports has been continuously increasing for the last few decades, whether these extreme sports should be encouraged has been a heated debate and drawn attention from the public. Considering this, some analyst argue that people should not play these sports, while others believe it helps people to increase their confidence. This essay will discuss some advantages and disadvantages of adventure sports before giving a conclusion.\n\nTo begin, most people are keen to play extreme sports for many reasons. Perhaps the fundamental reason is that, people want to overcome fear against certain things. For example, bungee jumping, a sport which people leap off from several hundred metres high with just a rope tied to their feet, requires a great deal of courage. Another important reason is that, these sports tend to be highly stimulating. It is often a good way to relieve anxiety and tension which come from various aspects. Above all, playing these games person becomes physically and mentally fit due to which he or she can live his or her life in a healthy way.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of extreme sports say that, these sports are very dangerous which may cause life-threatening threat. For instance, if a rope tears while bungee jumping, a participant will be seriously injured or even die. In addition, equipment needed for these sports are very expensive, sometimes a person cannot purchase them which increases the chance of tragedy. Furthermore, youngsters who gravitate toward these types of sports do not concentrate on their studies, due to which they are not able to get lucrative jobs.\n\nTo sum up, we can say that adventure sports have many impressive benefits including problem solving, self-confidence and team-work. However, it is recommended that these sports should be practiced under proper guidance and supervision of a guard. ",

    "content": "The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education - Einstein. What does he mean by that?",
    "answer": "The well-­known physicist Albert Einstein once said, “The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education”, which has attracted numerous controversies and attention from the public. In my opinion, this quote means that traditional education impedes the creativity of a child and does not allow building imagination.\n\nFirst and foremost, I think it is because of many successful people such as William Shakespeare, Steven Jobs and Abraham Lincoln dropout from schools but still achieved success in their lives that illustrates the truth of Einstein’s saying. Nowadays, many education institutions are structured that only teach students stressed rote memorization rather than any analytical and creative skills. Although potentially positive impact that traditional education system has must be taken into account, I reckon that one should follow his instincts and nature to realize one’s true potential. For example, a well-­known philosopher once said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge”, which has a significant influence on my childhood.\n\nMoreover, another factor should be considered is the psychological reason, which in other words, students are stressed and pressured due to the education system and their parents’ expectation, which has caused a considerable burden on children. Our education system should facilitate and encourage students to pursue their dreams with passionate not force them to adopt the knowledge and certain career paths. A recent research published in The Scientist has revealed that there are 80% higher chances for a child to success if he has interest and passion for doing something.\n\nIn conclusion, I hold the view that one should choose their desired profession without being interfered by the education system, parents, and society. Only in this way could a person achieve success.",

    "content": "Talk about the pros and cons of this era as is full of daily inventions. Any recent invention you think proved beneficial or detrimental to society?",
    "answer": "Nowadays, whether the development of daily inventions and technologies are beneficial or detrimental to society has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. In my opinions, an invention such as the computer has both pros and cons to our daily life.\n\nFirst and foremost, it has been argued that the technological reason is why I think computer are beneficial to our society. The potential positive impact that the invention of the computer has in many ways enormously changed people’s life must be taken into account. For example, with the invention of the computer, we can deal various tasks just by a click of a button in few minutes, which might take years of time to accomplish in many years ago. In addition, the computer allows distant education that is beneficial to a student in developing countries by giving him the access to a lecture of any professors in the developed countries such as the United Kingdom and America.\n\nHowever, another factor should be considered is the physical and psychological reasons, which in other words, the people are getting lazy, obese and introvert with the existence of the computer. This could be particularly a cause of people addicted to their own world with computer games, massive Internet information and reluctant to communicate with others. A recent research published in The Scientist that 80% of people have more or fewer health problems because people are leading a sedentary life due to the invention of the computer and other electronic equipment.\n\nIn conclusion, I hold the view that the recent invention of the computer has both advantageous and disadvantageous aspects on people’s life. To address this issue, the government, and the society should make a concerted effort to find solutions.",

    "content": "It is argued that getting married before finishing school or getting a job is not a good choice. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "answer": "Marriage is an important journey in every person’s life. Leading a successful married life depends not only on love but on economic and social factors as well. Rushing into marriage at an early age has both its roots in the orthodox customs as well as, today’s generation’s unrealistic romantic expectations. In this essay, I will elucidate why getting married before getting educated is a bad idea.\n\nThere are a considerable number of reasons for not getting married before finishing school, and the most striking one would be it hinders individual development. I believe that getting marries before finishing school is irresponsible, it has affected millions of young girls all over the world, especially in the developing world. As soon as these young girls get married, they become fully engaged in all domestic burdens, marital responsibilities and even raise children, in those cases, most married women are highly likely to withdraw from school and become full-time housewives. For example, a famous philosopher once said “People are supposed to get married only when they are financially and mentally ready”, which has a great impact on my opinion about marriage.\n\nAlthough people have rights to get married once they reach a certain age, it cannot be denied that some of the effects are very devastating to both individuals and national development. For individuals, the effects of early marriage include psychological problems, a high possibility of divorce, as well as hindering personal and educational development. A recent research published on the Scientific America revealed that around 75% of people who got married when they were under 20 years old ended up divorcing. Girls are regarded as family burdens in developing countries such as China and India, families tend to marry their daughters off early to get rid of financial burden, as a result, these girls are less likely to receive a good education and pursue a career. This example illustrates that the devastating effect of early marriage.\n\nIn order to have a successful and happy married life, it is imperative for both the partners to be educated and settled. Eventually, as with every marriage there will be stresses and pressures, uneducated partners are prone to have more marriage problems since they are more likely to be stuck in financial difficulties.",

    "content": "Learning a new language at an early age is helpful for children. Is it more positive for their future aspect or have some adverse effects. Do you agree or disagree? Give examples from your experience.",
    "answer": "Traditionally, children have begun studying foreign languages at secondary school, but introducing them earlier is recommended by some educationalists. Some people believe that studying a new languages at an early age is helpful for children while others disagree, in my opinion, I believe that there are significant benefits to being exposed to a second language as a child.\n\nThe obvious argument in its favour is that young children pick up languages much more easily than teenagers. Their brains are still programmed to acquire their mother tongue, which facilitates learning another language, and unlike adolescents, they are not inhibited by self-consciousness. The greater flexibility of the primary timetable allows for more frequent, shorter sessions and for a play-centred approach, thus maintaining learners’ enthusiasm and progress. Their command of the language in later life will benefit from this early exposure, while learning other languages subsequently will be easier for them. They may also gain a better understanding of other cultures.   \n\nThere are, however, some disadvantages. Primary school teachers are generalists, and may not have the necessary language skills themselves. If specialists have to be brought in to deliver these sessions, the flexibility referred to above is diminished. If primary language teaching is not standardised, secondary schools could be faced with a great variety of levels in different languages within their intake, resulting in a classroom experience which undoes the earlier gains. There is no advantage if enthusiastic primary pupils become demotivated as soon as they change schools. However, these issues can be addressed strategically within the policy adopted.   \n\nAnything which encourages language learning benefits society culturally and economically, and early exposure to language learning contributes to this. Young children’s innate abilities should be harnessed to make these benefits more achievable.  ",

    "answer": "In recent decades, low cost airfare has made international travel easier and many countries have, therefore, developed their tourism industries into sectors of their economies. While it is clear tourism brings obvious benefits to the countries that host tourists, it is also true to say it may bring disadvantages as well.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are significant benefits that tourism brings to a country. First, a thriving tourist industry implies an increasing need for a variety of services such as hotels, transport, restaurants, and entertainment. This results in a considerable number of jobs being created for people who lack college education and also the development of the infrastructure needed to accommodate visitors. Moreover, tourism is a “green” industry that, unlike factories, generates a low level of pollution. In fact, because beautiful natural landscapes are often places that tourists come to see, a country will often be sure to maintain the landscape in order to keep it attractive for tourists.\n\nDespite the benefits, there are aspects of tourism that may prove harmful to a country. For instance, country may suffer from the loss of their traditional culture. This is caused by people in a country changing their lifestyle, customs, and language in order to more effectively serve visitors or because they become influenced by foreign countries. This can cause stress in a traditional society and could even lead to animosity towards tourists. In addition, because tourists often carry expensive objects like cameras and are unaware of their surroundings, they make good targets for theft. Crime also increases as a result of the increases in drugs and prostitution that cater to some vacationers.\n\nIn summary, global tourism is greatly beneficial to the economy and environment of a country. However, it can be detrimental in several ways. To my way of thinking, a country should seek to develop its tourism industry because it can bring steady supply of jobs to many people without their need for higher education and without the risk of environmental damages.",

    "answer": "It is conspicuous that, throughout history, the thinking of a group of people is impacting the lives of thousands of civilians. Whether it is considered on a political or social level, a set of decisions of a group explains how a society should work. I completely agreed that, in the conflict of interest between different countries or different groups, it is the innocent people who sacrifice their lives. \n\nTo begin with, if ones have different ideas and beliefs regarding religion, culture, and politics than others, it may result in clashes or conflicts. In addition, the situation becomes more problematic and dangerous when this is between two larger groups rather than individuals; it refers to as a war of ideas. \n\nFirst of all, during World War II, a group of countries namely US, UK and China attacked Japan with explosive atomic bombs destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing more than one lakh civilians. This is a clear example of the decision laid by a few countries against Japan to surrender to its allies. Though, these countries achieved victory in their mission but Japanese people are still suffering from the radioactive radiation effect which resulted in blindness and mental disorders. Thus, we can say that political ideologies of a group can drastically harm society.\n\nIn addition, September 11 attacks on US by a group of 19 militants, associated with Islamic extremist group, hijacked four airplanes and killed around 3,000 people by colliding airplanes into symbolic US landmark. This example clearly shows how the decision and planning of these terrorist activists took lives of thousands of innocent people.\n\nTo conclude, I restate that conflicts of ideas are inevitable(unavoidable) so individuals should respect the ideas of others so that this world can be more peaceful and prosperous.",

    "content": "In a cashless society, people use more credit cards, do you think cashless society is realistic and why? What are the advantages and disadvantages?",
    "answer": "Cashless society is in the centre of discussion in recent times, substantial arguments have been raised on whether or not we should embrace cashless transaction. Needless to say, cashless movement is inevitable as there has been an upsurge in the adoption of electronic payment from the public. Therefore, both side of the equation associated with such payment method will be discussed to provide detailed insights on the implication in cashless adoption.\n\nTo achieve cashless, one must first acknowledge that there is a plethora of benefits associated with cashless transaction. In the modern world where society is moving at increasingly faster pace, convenience is an undisputed selling point in many technological advances. Unlike cash payment, electronic payments not only speed up the action of moving money from one party to another but also eliminate the need to perform difference calculation which is susceptible to human error. As the entire process is computerized in the absence of physical contact, its simplicity therefore allows faster, accurate and most of all, convenient transactional experience.\n\nOn the other hand, moving to cashless usually implies surrendering one’s anonymity as each electronic transaction is documented. Generally speaking, most cashless transaction uses credit or debit card issued by financial institutes that profiles individuals spending patterns. The data compiled by these banks could be used for exploitative nature such as targeted advertising or other invasive agendas. Regardless one’s choice between convenience or privacy, its drawback should not be overlooked.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the impact of credit card is prominent, although the way electronic transactions might invade privacy should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "Some universities deduct mark on a student’s work if it is given late. What is your opinion? What alternative actions do you recommend to take?",
    "answer": "Late assignment penalty has always been a controversial topic in our education system, deducting marks in particular, is a popular form of academic penalty practiced by many education institutes. A detailed analysis below will outline both the pros and cons of such a widely practiced method to form an unbiased conclusion.\n\nTo begin, marks deduction is a form of learning which puts strong emphasis on one’s responsibility. By enacting late submission policy, students may experience a sense of urgency and feel more compelled to complete the task prior to the due date. Furthermore, it is fair to those students who respect the rule while putting in the effort to complete the task on time. Ultimately, the negative consequence for not finishing the assignment on time is an important lesson on meeting deadlines which the students should learn from.\n\nOn the opposite of the spectrum, this type of policy is not without adverse effect. For example, one may argue that such method of punishment is unwarranted, as the assessment is not focusing objectively on the quality of the assignment, but rather shifting onto one’s behaviour. Notwithstanding the aforementioned case, imposing such academic penalty could lead to potential, technically justified, yet unfortunate dismissal of outstanding work.\n\nIn the light of the discussion above, it can be concluded that despite the unpopular nature of deducting marks amongst students, it is still an effective method to reduce the occurrence of late assignment.",

    "content": "Effective learning requires time, comfort and peace so it is impossible to combine study and employment. Study and employment distract one from another. To what extent do you think the statements are realistic? Support your opinion with examples. ",
    "answer": "Both studying and working require time commitment, and it is debatable that one could reserve enough time for both. While some people argue that such a combination can be managed with effective planning, many, however, are not convinced as they believe study and employment interfere with each other. In this discussion, we will outline few scenarios and use facts to find out just how likely one can attain success while juggling both.\n\nA large portion of people who find impossible to study and work at the same time is because of the poor time management. Research have shown that a majority of failed attempts are due to under-estimating the study workload. A typical example would be when one enrols in a course, this person who already has made substantial time commitment for work, fails to comprehend the amount of additional commitment required for the course. And when the due dates for assessments are approaching, the old strategy of staying up late will be increasingly difficult to execute and more often than not, it leads to inevitable disaster.\n\nHowever, through proper planning, time management and most importantly – self-discipline, one could avoid making such costly mistake. For example, one should give an honest assessment on the study load and adjust accordingly to ensure enough time is allocated. Only by strictly adhere to the plan and avoid procrastination, one may succeed in such an endeavour. In the professional world, many people frequently broaden their knowledge as part of career progression and it is not unusual to enrol in learning and development course at one’s own time. \n\nIn the light of the discussion above, it can be concluded that simultaneously managing employment and study can be challenging, but not impossible if one takes adequate preparation and planning.

    "content": "Rather than choosing a subject that lead to future employment, students should choose a subject that they are interested in and motivate them to get good grades. Do you agree or disagree?",
    "answer": "Nowdays, the topic of choosing the right subject for students has attracted considerable controversies and drawn attention from the public. It can be agreed that picking subjects to increase employment prospect is crucial, while on the other hand stands a perspective that pursuing personal interest and finding one’s calling can be more meaningful in life. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous benefits for choosing subjects that lead to employment, and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that it promotes “safer passage of life” where increased prospect of stability in having a job is desired by many. Additionally, these subjects are typically industry focused and above all, bring sense of purpose which is a key motivation for the students. As a result, a combination of pragmatism and tangible advantages of this approach is too hard to ignore.\n\nAlternatively, the key justification of picking subjects that interest and motivate students is that it enables them to self-discover and harness their innate talent, which otherwise may go unnoticed. Furthermore, the famous motte of “being the best at what you love to do” is often regarded as the holy grail in measuring one’s purpose in life. Despite the fact that this path can be adventurous, challenging and even uncertain to a degree, finding one’s calling in life is the ultimate reward that makes everything worthwhile. \n\nIn the light of the discussion above, it can be concluded that picking subjects for either purpose of increasing career prospect or of developing personal traits is equally meaningful in shaping the future of students, and the potential benefits are far reaching and should not be overlooked.",

It can be agreed that there are obvious benefits in rising such age requirement, while on the other hand stands a perspective that imposing such restriction comes with adverse consequences. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons for rising age restriction on certain activities and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that young people’s brain aren’t fully developed until age 25 or so. In fact, research has found that comparing to young adults’ brains, fully developed adult brains function differently, especially in the frontal cortex where critical rational part resides. For example, youngsters sometimes experience overwhelming emotional inputs which cloud their judgement that they can’t explain what they were thinking. As a result, at age 25, the brain is likely to have a balanced emotional and decision capability which is crucial in important event such as voting.\n\nIn addition to aforementioned justification, the fact that young people tend to be thrill seeking in relation to driving, it’s much likely for them to engage in unsafe behaviour such as speeding, reckless driving and statistical speaking, the increased risk in car accident is exponentially higher for a 16-year-old than a 25-year-old. Furthermore, these undisputable figures are reflected in increased insurance premiums for young people. Because of that, the associated risks far outweigh any benefits for young drivers.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the impact of increased age requirement for driving and voting is prominent, and the potential benefits can be far reaching and should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "Some schools put all exams at the end of the year, while some other schools give exams throughout the whole year. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the two-exam system? Which one do you think is better?",
    "answer": "Nowdays, the challenge in finding most suitable exam system has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be agreed that put all exams at the end of year is a well practiced in many schools, while on the other hand stands a perspective that giving exams throughout the whole offer some other benefits.  This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThere are many advantages of schedule exam at end of year and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that students who are well versed in the entire course will be rewarded and those who fall behind could still have a chance to catch up. However, this system is not always supported. For example, some argue that cramming all exams at end can only inflict unnecessary stress to the students. This argument, however, is only partial true. Such exam format could bring forth overwhelming amount of pressure and excitement, which is an epitome of what many real-world experiences is about. As a result, put all exams at the end of the year is undoubtably positive for most peers.\n\nAlternatively, the key justification for distributing exams throughout the whole year is that these exams are designed to effectively test students over specific topics, and the process from absorbing to assessing knowledge becomes a seamless learning experience despite its deceivingly fragmented approach. Nevertheless, there remains some disadvantages including absence of intense pressure and more critically, abysmal chances for fall behind students to catch up.\n\nIn the light of discussion above, it can be concluded that both exam systems are effective in their own right and school’s role in choosing best suited exam system for a particular course should not be overlooked.",

    "answer": "Nowadays, the topic on limiting vehicle usage to protect the environment has attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be agreed that reducing vehicle emission could alleviate environmental pressure to a certain extent, while on the other hand stands a perspective that adopting such change can be challenging for the public. This essay will elaborate on both side and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why driving puts substantial stress on the environment and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that vehicle emits gas pollutants which not only degrades air quality but also contributes to greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide. A striking example is Beijing’s air, where the quality rapidly exacerbates when a record number of vehicles are on the road. Furthermore, car production involves mining and refining of an extraordinary number of minerals and the extraction processes are often some of the worst offender in killing our environment.\n\nAdditionally, reducing cars on the road will ease much needed traffic congestion in big cities such as Sydney, particularly during peak hour rush. Having such initiatives would influence government to invest on public transport instead of expanding or upgrading roads, all of which would reduce our ecological footprint. \n\nIn the light of the discussion above, it can be concluded that despite the fact that cars provide irreplaceable freedom, safety and comfort to us, the impact of car emission on the environment is prominent and should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "School children are doing less sport and exercise than their parents when they were young. How far do you agree with this statement? Give some examples from your personal experience.",
    "answer": "There is no doubt that there has been a considerable shift in the behaviour in the school children today. Compare to the parents, who likely have grown up predominantly in environments with plentiful of physical activities; modern day children have a higher statistical rate of leading sedentary lifestyles. This essay explores just how much “less active” the current school children are compared to their parents.\n\nUnlike many parents whose upbringing have revolved around conventional leisure such as parks, bikes or sports, in an internet enabled world, children these days have much broader options. From my observation, one of the striking trends is that the explosion of online gaming in the recent years are luring away children from physical leisure and pulling them further indoors. As a result of such shift, for some children, internet has occupied most, if not all of their time which lead to them live in an environment that is heavily sedative.\n\nOn the opposite of the spectrum, there has been a renewed interest in health and fitness in the last couple years, with a record number of students taking initiative to get started with sports and exercises. A recent study published by Scientific America has revealed that with heavy promotion on student discount going around, a staggering 81% of participants in school age are a member of a club of some sort, such as sports, gym or other recreational clubs. Therefore, there has been an upsurge of participation in physical and outdoor activities in these school kids.\n\nIn the light of the discussion above, it can be concluded that some kids definitely spend their time indoor more than ever before; however, many others are still engaged with an active lifestyle.",

    "answer": "Nowadays, a significant amount of money is spent on the maintenance of old structures in many cities. Some people believe that the same amount may be utilized for other infrastructure projects instead of the above. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why building should be restored and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that historical buildings play a key role to preserve the culture and promote tourism. The road side buildings in old cities are usually stone structures that represent the culture and heritage of that place. Many of them are in poor condition. Even so, in my opinion, they should be restored because these buildings are strongly attached to the history of the city. If they are demolished, a part of the history will also die out and it is a national loss. On the other hand, maintaining buildings of historical value in good condition is a great way to bring tourism to the city. The tourism generates new employment opportunities and revenue, which is beneficial to the local economy. Therefore, spending on preserving ancient buildings should be prioritised. \n\nHaving said that, those buildings that are beyond repair should definitely be demolished and new structures should be built in their place. Allowing them to stay in their dilapidated state poses serious threat to life and property.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that the maintenance and preservation of ancient buildings is prominent, although those buildings that cannot be restored should be destroyed.",

    "content": "The use of English seems to be growing as the world interconnected, what reasons cause this phenomenon and what are the disadvantages and advantages of this?",
    "answer": "As a part of globalisation English has become the most widely spoken language around the world. While there are many benefits to using English as a global language, it also has some negative effects.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why English is the most widespread language in the world, and the most conspicuous one stems from the political, cultural and economic pre-eminence of the United States. To be more specific, the expansion of English has happened alongside the increasing popularity of American culture. The American film, music and fashion industries are as dominant as global American companies and products, such as Microsoft or the iPod. As a result, the use of English is still growing as the world interconnected. \n\nOne the one hand, there are certain benefits of using the same language across the world. First off, using a single language worldwide promotes understanding and economic cooperation amongst nations. At the same time, it becomes easier to discuss terms of trade and trade negotiations when a single language is used worldwide. On the other hand, languages spoken by small communities could become extinct as people learn English in order to find work. This would obviously have a negative effect on local cultures, customs and traditions because the new dominant language would bring its own culture with it. \n\nNevertheless, there remain some drawbacks, which can certainly overshadow the potential influence of growth in English language, and the most alarming one is rooted in the erosion of other languages and their associated cultures.",

    "content": "Advanced technology such as artificial intelligence can translate a foreign language easily. Do you think learning a foreign language is still necessary? Support with your own experience.",
    "answer": "As a result of technology advancement, foreign languages can be easily interpreted by artificial intelligence in this digital era, this attracted numerous controversies and drawn the attention from the public. It can be said that it is useless for children to become bilingual or multilingual, while on the other hand stands a perspective that learning a foreign language is necessary. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion. \n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons why it is necessary to learn a foreign language and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that language translations through software are often inaccurate. Although every learner can translate foreign languages with the help of some translation tools, the inaccuracy of them cannot be ignored. As an illustration, Google Translate is not always able to capture the real meaning of the words or sentences. However, this issue can be avoided when people themselves translate because they can organize the structure of sentences based on their knowledge and skills.\n\nAnother key justification for upholding this notion is that learning a new language can bring a lot of benefits, especially for youngsters. Moreover, learning a foreign language also provides learners with an opportunity to learn about different cultures. Another benefit is that being a bilingual person can earn them more opportunities in their later life. A person with the ability to speak different languages can become competitive in the fierce job markets, and it is conducive for their career prospects. Thus, learning a second language is vital.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that although translation tools are helpful, the way how translation software causes misunderstandings should not be overlooked.",

    "content": "Some people think air travel has more negative impact than positive on modern life. What do you think?",
    "answer": "One of the highly controversial issues today relates to whether air travel has more negative impact than positive on modern life. It can be argued that air travel enables more people to travel to various destinations, while on the other hand stands a perspective that air travel has remarkably affected the environment. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion.\n\nAt the outset, there are numerous reasons ways how air travel could benefit modern life and the most conspicuous one stems from the fact that low-cost flights have enabled people to travel to far away destinations that they otherwise could have never visited. A second point is that affordable air travel can unquestionably contribute to booming of international trade and tourism, hence creating more job opportunities for many people around the globe. A recent research published on the European Tourism Association revealed that the number of European tourists visiting France trebled in the period after low fare flights were introduced in Europe. Thus, air travel creates jobs and drives economic growth.\n\nNevertheless, some people hold an opposing view and tend to believe that the drawbacks of increased air traffic considerably outweigh its advantages and that governments should mitigate the negative influence of cheap air flights by inflicting more taxes on the carriers of these flights. The main reason for believing this is that the increasing number of airports and the stupendous number of flights have remarkably affected the environment. This is seen in the unprecedented levels of air pollution and noise pollution recorded in the past two decades. Therefore, it cannot be denied that traveling by air has a negative environmental impact. \n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that although the benefit of air travel is prominent, its negative environmental impact should be well handled by governments.",

    "content": "Should there be a maximum wage for high pay people? Is it good or bad?",
    "answer": "Nowadays, people have different views about whether governments should introduce a maximum wage. In some ways it may seem reasonable to allow people to earn as much as companies are willing to pay, while on the other hand stands a perspective that employee remuneration should be capped at a certain level. This essay will elaborate on both sides and thus will lead to logical conclusion. \n\nThere are various reasons why it might be considered beneficial to allow people to be paid extremely high salaries. If companies offer excellent pay packages, they can attract the most talented people in their fields to work for them. For example, technology companies like Google are able to employ the best programmers because of the huge sums that they are willing to pay. Furthermore, these well-paid employees are likely to be highly motivated to work hard and therefore drive their businesses successfully. In theory, this should result in a thriving economy and increased tax revenues, which means that paying high salaries benefits everyone.\n\nNevertheless, some people hold an opposing view and tend to believe that there should be a maximum wage. By introducing a limit on earnings, the pay-gap between bosses and employees can be reduced. Currently, the difference between normal and top salaries is huge, and this can demotivate workers who feel that the situation is unfair. With lower executive salaries, it might become feasible to introduce higher minimum wages, and everybody would be better off. One possible consequence of greater equality could be that poverty and crime rates fall because the general population will experience an improved standard of living.\n\nIn light of discussion above, it can be concluded that having excellent pay package is prominent for some companies to attract the best talents, although the way how it causes society inequality should be well handled.",
