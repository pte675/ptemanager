    "answer_ai": "The image shows the determinants of happiness. It also provides information in three categories, namely the genetic set point, intentional activities, and life circumstances, measured in proportions. It is clear from the image that the genetic set point category has the highest proportion, which is approximately 50%. On the other hand, the life circumstances category has the lowest proportion, which is around 10%. ######After analyzing the image, it can be concluded that this image is showing crucial information about what determines happiness. The graph strongly supports the idea that a significant proportion of happiness is determined by our genetics, with intentional activities also playing a substantial role. Conversely, life circumstances have a relatively smaller impact on overall happiness. These findings highlight the importance of both our inherent disposition and the ways in which we actively engage in activities that promote happiness.",

From the first picture, we can see that there is a meander and along the meander, there are lots of trees, there is also a neck in between the meander. However, when we move to the next stage, the sand becomes deposited in the river and finally, it becomes silt around the river neck, therefore there is a new channel formed and a new oxbow lake begins to run in this way. In conclusion, the formation of the oxbow lake requires water and sand forces to shape its channels.",
