Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant and noticed details about its leaves and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside.

When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow and think spring is on its way, you ’ re using phenology. When you see leaves turn from green to red, and watch migrating birds fly past, and realize that summer is over, autumn is here, you ’ re using phenology. Literally meaning, “ the science of appearance ”, phenology comes from the Greek words “ pheno, ” to show or appear, and “ logos, ” to study. Humans have relied on phenology since the time of hunters and gatherers. We ’ ve watched changes in seasons to know when to plant and harvest food and when to track migrating animals. Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events. Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently. Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift. Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant ’ s leaf or flower buds open, is occurring earlier in the year for some species.

    "question": "While a written word might have multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler with vital information. This is where “ um ” and “ uh ” come in. Or “ eh ” and “ ehm, ” “ tutoa ” and “öö, ” “ eto ” and “ ano. ” Linguists call these filled pauses, which are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal that you ’ re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word for a situation. And they don ’ t just benefit the speaker — a filled pause lets your listeners know an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found that people are more likely to remember a word if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena aren ’ t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “ like, ” “ well ” or “ you know ” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey something about the sentence in which they appear.",

    "question": "Why can ’ t we transplant brains? First of all, we should look at what the brain actually does. This thing inside our skulls that weighs on average about 3.3 pounds is larger in humans than any other vertebrae when compared to body weight. That ’ s why we are so brainy. The busy brain is our command center for our nervous system, which takes in data from our body and gives directions to our muscles. In fact, it does so much work, it requires about 20 percent of our energy to run it. When we are brain dead, we no longer have any neurological activity. With the help of machines, we can be kept alive for a short time, but within a week, the body will not be able to function. While we may still be alive in some sense for that week, we are technically dead when the brain is dead. Some good news is that during the time we are kept alive, some of our other organs can be donated. But why can ’ t we accept someone else ’ s brain? When we transplant something such as a heart, surgeons use a mechanical pump to keep blood flooding through the body while the new heart is being put in. The new heart is then connected to the major blood vessels, and this might take several hours. You ’ ll stay in the hospital for one to two weeks, and if your body doesn ’ t reject its new heart, it ’ s said 87 out of 100 people make it through the year, and 60 out of 100 get through another decade. So, wouldn ’ t it just be possible to open the skull and connect a new brain where the removed brain was connected? This question was asked to a Professor of Neurosurgery at Yale in 2013. He actually did say that one day this operation might be successful, but right now we are not even close. The reason is because it ’ s just too darn difficult to connect nerve fibers from the new brain to the native spinal cord. This, he said, is why spinal cord injuries can be so devastating. If we could transplant brains, we would likely not have so many people that are disabled due to spinal injuries.",

    "question": "But what exactly happens to your body when you ’ re in a coma? First we have to be clear that comas are very different from sleep. Despite the fact that the origin of the word comes from the Greek for Koma, or deep sleep, comas are not sleep however and are instead various forms of unconsciousness that render a person unable to respond to any external stimuli. You can play the loudest, heaviest death metal in the world right next to someone who ’ s comatose, and you won ’ t succeed in doing anything except really annoying the neighbors. Likewise you can even physically hurt people in a coma and they will remain completely oblivious and unresponsive. In times not too distant past, this was sometimes used as treating, with doctors trying to shock their victims back into consciousness. Everything was tried from exposing parts of the body to open flames to severely dropping the body ’ s temperature with ice, to even bloodletting from the head directly. One treatment even included wholly emptying the stomach, we guess because the doctors thought that if a patient got hungry enough, the body would force them to wake up. Or maybe they really were just throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the problem, which we ’ re sure was also tried. Comas can occur as a result of serious trauma or as a deliberate medical treatment by doctors. They are typically brought on by traumatic head injury, and it ’ s believed that it ’ s the brain ’ s way of shutting down so it can focus on repairing itself. They can also however be brought on by a stroke, a brain tumor, drug or alcohol abuse, or an illness such as diabetes or an infection.

    "question": "We ’ ve all heard the phrase “ Laughter is the best medicine. ” But why do we laugh in the first place? It seems that laughing might be a little more hard-wired into us than you might think. Infants laugh very early in life, usually learning how to laugh before they can speak. Not only that, but people that are born blind and deaf can still exhibit laughter. One study found that the laughter produced from deaf participants was fundamentally similar to that produced by normally hearing individuals, backing up the idea that laughter is grounded in human biology. It ’ s also been theorized that laughter predates human speech by potentially millions of years, being a simpler form of communication. Laughter is thought to have likely helped earlier people negotiate group dynamics and establish hierarchy. I can ’ t even imagine trying to explain that I ’ m a little goofball using only laughter! So if laughter actually is instinctually part of humans, then why do people laugh? It seems like laughter is more of a way for people to better handle stress and make situations feel less threatening than laughter only being about things that we find to be funny. In practice, with a study of 1, 200 people that laughed spontaneously in their natural environments, only about 10-20 percent of the laughing episodes followed anything the researchers found to be joke-like. Finding something funny still seems to play a part in why we laugh some of the time, but laughing to make yourself feel better about your next difficult exam might be just as probable as cracking up over that joke you just heard.",

    "question": "Well, according to the American Psychiatric Association, addiction is a complex condition of the brain where a person has compulsive substance use despite there being harmful consequences. People with addiction tend to have an intense focus on what they ’ re addicted to, to the point where it takes over their life. What makes it so hard to break an addiction is that it can change the way your brain is wired, giving you harsh cravings that make it difficult to stop. Studies of brain imaging have even shown changes in areas of the brain that relate to judgement, decision making, learning, memory, and behavior control. So is this what ’ s happening with Facebook and social media? It ’ s hard to say for sure. That being said, we are starting to give more credit to an addiction that might be pretty similar: video games. That ’ s because the American Psychiatric Association includes Internet Gaming Disorders as disorders that requires further research, but that can result in clinically significant impairment or distress. The World Health Organization has also added Gaming disorders to their International Classification of Diseases, which is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions. Now online video games are obviously not the same as a site like Facebook, yet they do have similar social aspects. It ’ s possible that in the future we ’ ll see health organizations also classifying social media as a type of addiction or disorder. Still, sites like Facebook do have quite a few qualities that make you want to come back to them. Through constant feeds that go on forever and giving you push notifications on your phone, social media sites try their best to keep you on their app or website, and if you leave they want you to come back as quickly as possible. Google and Facebook further their reach by also being commonly used to sign into other sites.

    "question": "Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed greatly across cultures, the practice is as old as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian mummy dating back to 6, 000 BCE. But have you ever wondered how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40, 000 skin cells per hour. That ’ s about 1, 000, 000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn ’ t gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison ’ s engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles, loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50 to 3, 000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers, nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent.",

It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth ’ s surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO 2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth.

    "question": "But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like? We all know the short answer. It feels terrible. Regret feels awful. But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial. When I went home that night after getting my tattoo, I basically stayed up all night. And for the first several hours, there was exactly one thought in my head. And the thought was, “ Make it go away! ” This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response. I mean, it ’ s right up there with, “ I want my mommy! ” We ’ re not trying to solve the problem. We ’ re not trying to understand how the problem came about. We just want it to vanish. The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was, “ How could I have done that? What was I thinking? ” This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret. We can ’ t identify with that part. We don ’ t understand that part. And we certainly don ’ t have any empathy for that part — which explains the third consistent component of regret, which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. That ’ s why, in the face of our regret, the thing we consistently say is, “ I could have kicked myself. ” The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing. Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. So it ’ s not that I sat there in my bedroom that night, thinking, “ Make it go away. ” It ’ s that I sat there and I thought, “ Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away. ” So if you look at the psychological literature, these are the four consistent defining components of regret.",

    "question": "So then begs the question, what if we cover the entire desert with solar panels? How much energy would we actually be able to produce and how would this change our planet? Let ’ s take a deep dive. For starters, let ’ s begin here. This is the where ’ s that solar power station in Morocco, the world ’ s largest concentrated solar power plant currently in existence in a marvel of modern engineering. Once fully completed and operational, the plant will take up an area of 25 square kilometers and be capable of producing 582 megawatts of electricity. It will even be capable of storing solar energy in the form of superheated molten salt, which allows for further production of electricity even into the night. After investing more than 9 billion dollars into their solar energy objective, Morocco aims to create 4 additional plants similar to this one in the Sahara that will collectively create more than 2000 megawatts of electricity production which will be enough to provide for roughly 38% of all of Morocco ’ s annual electricity needs. This project will transform Morocco into the world ’ s leading solar energy state, and as the only African country that currently has a power cable linked to Europe, much of this energy will be exported for profit to the countries of the European Union.

Maybe, we only care about truth in so far as it empowers us: knowing and thinking about all of the details of every orange tree would just be a psychological burden for the most of us. I ’ ll take illusion over the reality. But I can ’ t help but ask, “ Is it possible that the mind is actually accessing a deeper kind of truth? ” Maybe, the mind is separating the signal from the noise. But, what constitutes signal versus noise? Our values. A farmer that values knowing all the details of an orange tree will view it differently than a regular person. Well, where do our values come from? Here ’ s Nietzsche ’ s view from Beyond Good and Evil: “ Behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there too stand valuations or, more clearly, physiological demands for the preservation of a certain type of life. ” For Nietzsche, our values come from our physiological demands, and what does our physiology demand? Power. It wants to survive and thrive. What does it mean to thrive? To imagine the world a certain way and to be able to make that illusion a reality. Someone could try to contest this idea, by saying that they don ’ t seek power or want to thrive, they won ’ t eat or drink anything to prove this point.

So the target of blame: each of these five high-conflict personalities tends to zero in generally on one person. It could change over time, but they see that person as the cause of all their problems. And so they want to control that person, or eliminate that person, or destroy or humiliate that person. It ’ s a fixation on one person. And all of their life problems they emotionally focus on that person. So you don ’ t want to be one of those folks. How to avoid being a target of blame? First of all, if you see warning signs of this behavior, don ’ t get too close to such a person. You may be a friend, but don ’ t be the closest friend. You may be a co-worker, but don ’ t be the closest co-worker. Because what seems to happen is the people they get really close to are the ones that are most at-risk of becoming their targets of blame. But it could be anybody. They tend to target intimate others and people in authority. So this could be boyfriends, girlfriends, husbands, wives, parents, children, co-workers, neighbors they get close to. It also could be police, could be a government agency, or government official, could be their boss, could be the company owner.

Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum correspond to different types of radiation. And, many of them are perfectly harmless. Some of them can be dangerous though. Radiation with very short wavelengths like UV Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms, which can cause burns and genetic damage. This is what many people have in mind when they hear the term “ radiation ”. The rest of the spectrum covers a large range of longer waves from Visible Light, Infrared, Microwaves to Radio Waves. This is the kind of radiation that ’ s emitted by all sorts of human technology: mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, electric power lines, and household appliances. This radiation doesn ’ t disrupt molecules in our body. However, some kinds of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves and can also make the hair on your body vibrate, which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling above certain threshold values.

The second, we want only for the value they bring, though they may be onerous, like exercise or medicine. The third class comprises things we desire for their own sake and the value they offer, like knowledge and health. Glaucon argues that justice belongs to the second class of good: it ’ s a burden that nevertheless brings rewards.

Socrates argues that the human soul has three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. Reason guides an individual to truth and knowledge, and is influenced by either spirit or appetite. Spirit is righteous, ambitious, and the source of bold action, while appetite consists of baser, bodily desires.

    "question": "One of the most important principles of Einstein ’ s general relativity is the equivalence principle. It says that: all objects, regardless of their mass and composition, would accelerate in the same manner in the same gravitational field when no external forces act upon them. Confused? Let me put it in simple words. Suppose you simultaneously drop a feather and a stone towards the ground from the same height in a perfectly resistance-less environment. Which one, according to you, will touch the ground first? One may think that as a stone is more massive than a fragile feather, it should experience more gravitational force, and hit the ground first. But that ’ s not the case because as per the principle of equivalence, both objects should fall simultaneously on the ground. In other words, one can say that the inertial and gravitational mass of a body is proportional to each other, which makes the acceleration independent of the physical nature of the body. Now, what is the difference between inertial mass and gravitational mass? The mass that appears in Newton ’ s Second Law of Motion is termed inertial mass. It simply describes how difficult it is to accelerate an object. On the other hand, the mass that appears in Newton ’ s Universal Law of Gravitation is the gravitational mass. It depicts the strength with which gravity acts on a body. So although a stone has more gravitational mass than a feather, the force of gravity acting on it is greater. At the same time, its inertial mass is also greater, which makes it difficult to accelerate. So the two effects cancel out, and it falls with the same acceleration as that of the feather which is precisely the value of acceleration due to gravity in free fall. No matter how small, if there ’ s any violation in the proportionality between inertial and gravitational mass, Einstein ’ s entire system breaks down.",

Her age was so astounding that a millionaire pledged $1 million to anyone who could break her record. But in reality, living to this age or beyond is a feat that very few, maybe even no humans, are likely to accomplish. Human bodies just aren ’ t built for extreme aging. Our capacity is set at about 90 years. But what does aging really mean and how does it counteract the body ’ s efforts to stay alive? We know intuitively what it means to age. For some, it means growing up, while for others, it ’ s growing old. Yet finding a strict scientific definition of aging is a challenge. What we can say is that aging occurs when intrinsic processes and interactions with the environment, like sunlight, and toxins in the air, water, and our diets, cause changes in the structure and function of the body ’ s molecules and cells. Those changes in turn drive their decline, and subsequently, the failure of the whole organism. The exact mechanisms of aging are poorly understood.

Simple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals. Designing it is one thing; getting it built, we learned, is quite another. We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called “ Ubudehe, ” which means “ community works for the community. ” Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. Bruce was using the process of building to heal, not just for those who were sick, but for the entire community as a whole. We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or “ lo-fab ”, and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve.

So givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately, they suffer along the way.

Could we cultivate these NASA-type microbes in order to make valuable products here on Earth? And we started a company to do it. And in that company, we discovered that these hydrogenotrophs — which I ’ ll actually call nature ’ s supercharged carbon recyclers — we found that they are a powerful class of microbes that had been largely overlooked and understudied, and that they could make some really valuable products. So we began cultivating these products, these microbes, in our lab. We found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes. And we even made a protein-rich meal that has an amino acid profile similar to what you might find in some animal proteins. We began cultivating them even further, and we found that we can make oil. Oils are used to manufacture many products. We made an oil that was similar to a citrus oil, which can be used for flavoring and for fragrances, but it also can be used as a biodegradable cleaner or even as a jet fuel.

So they say in lower income neighborhoods kids forget anywhere from two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learned during the school year over the summer, while their middle-class peers break even or even make gains. When I first learned about the achievement gap I was a freshman in college and I certainly wanted to understand what the causes of it were. And as I started to do my research I realized that there were a thousand different reasons why the achievement gap existed: everything from a lack of positive role models to poor health conditions in so many of these inner-city and low-income neighborhoods. And then I found this startling statistic that said that two-thirds of the achievement gap could be directly attributed to unequal summer learning opportunities, or the summer learning loss. In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget anywhere from two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learn over the summer from the school year, and so when they return to school they ’ re now two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months behind their affluent or their middle class peers. Just to put that in perspective for you all: the school year from September to June is only ten months long. If a kid forgets two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learned, that ’ s almost 25 to 35 percent of their learning. Teachers have then reported that they spend anywhere from a month-and - a-half to two months reteaching old material. So if you add that additional 20 percent you ’ re talking about 50 percent of a kid ’ s learning.

Typically, it ’ s a silent act, where the person ’ s mouth sinks below the surface of the water and then reappears as they try to breathe. See, once they can no longer hold their initial breath and start to hyperventilate they might aspirate water, triggering something called a laryngospasm. This is where the person ’ s vocal cords spasm, blocking their airways and protecting their lungs. However, it also inconveniently makes yelling for help significantly harder to do. Since the person can ’ t take in any fresh air, their oxygen supply starts to fall, potentially leading to a condition called hypoxia, this is where there ’ s not enough oxygen reaching the body ’ s tissues. And eventually, as the person becomes unconscious, there ’ s a relaxation of their airway, allowing their lungs to fill with water. Depending on how long the person has gone without air, varying levels of damage can occur. For example, a 2013 study found that the likelihood of surviving with little to no brain damage was very low after being submerged for 10 minutes or more.

The biggest scientific factors for this, are focus, light scatter, and contrast. Let ’ s use a camera lens to explain the first one. Focusing is largely affected by how much light is coming into our eyes and how we focus that light. If a lot of light is coming in like when using light modes, eye pupils contract allowing less light in, creating a wide depth of field, meaning everything is in focus. If this is inverted, less light coming in, that causes our pupils to dilate and that creates a shallower plain of focus, meaning our eyes have to put more efforts into focusing on individual objects.

This practice reflects the widespread belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about the ethics of animal testing and how it ’ s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life, whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status has been seen as binary, either a being ’ s interests matter for their own sake, or they don ’ t. And historically, many philosophers believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn ’ t. Some contemporary philosophers like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then suggests that beings with these capacities are “ persons ” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “ things ” without moral status.

Others, like Christine Korsgaard, argue that certain non-human animals should also be included in a Kantian view of moral status based on how they value their own good.######In conclusion, the lecture emphasizes the ethical considerations surrounding animal testing and the difficult question of determining the value of a life. The concept of moral status, whether seen as binary or in degrees, plays a crucial role in these discussions, with philosophers offering various perspectives on the topic.",

    "question": "So in the process, I learn all of these incredibly wonderful theories that the smartest people who have ever lived have developed over the last 2, 500 years that help us make better decisions and become better people. For example, I learned about Immanuel Kant and the categorical imperative. So Kant says, when we're about to do something we have to design a rule or a maxim that we could will to be universal. Meaning, we have to imagine, what if everyone did what we're about to do, what would happen to the world? Would it be OK or would it get all screwed up? So the maxim I'm designing here is something like, anytime two people are in any kind of negotiation, one of them can drag into the negotiation an entirely unrelated global calamity and tell the other person that they shouldn't care about whatever they care about, because they should care about that instead. That world would suck, right? Like, your sister borrows five dollars from you, you ask for it back, she says, \" How dare you care about five dollars when the polar ice caps are melting? \" No one wants to live in this world, right? Kant also says, by the way, that you should treat people as ends in themselves, and not a means to an end, meaning, you shouldn't use people to get what you want. Well, that's what I was doing.",

    "question": "All organisms on earth are made from the same basic part, mostly proteins. Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes – you can imagine them as 3 D puzzle pieces. There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies. Why is this important? Because proteins are in a way the “ language ” of the micro-world. Cells don ’ t have eyes or ears, so to tell friend from foe, they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy. Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors, that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece. So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together, or recognize other protein puzzle pieces. When a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as “ enemy ”, it knows that it has to attack. Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader. But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces, this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces. This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year, the influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

    "question": "Why do we get used to everyday things? Well as human beings, we have limited brain power. And so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits, so we can free up space to learn new things. It ’ s a process called habituation and it ’ s one of the most basic ways, as humans, we learn. Now, habituation isn ’ t always bad. Remember learning to drive? I sure do. Your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel, looking at every single object out there — the cars, the lights, the pedestrians. It ’ s a nerve-wracking experience. So much so, that I couldn ’ t even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn ’ t even listen to music. But then something interesting happened. As the weeks went by, driving became easier and easier. You habituated it. It started to become fun and second nature. And then, you could talk to your friends again and listen to music. So there ’ s a good reason why our brains habituate things. If we didn ’ t, we ’ d notice every little detail, all the time. It would be exhausting, and we ’ d have no time to learn about new things. But sometimes, habituation isn ’ t good. If it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us, well, that ’ s bad.

So don ’ t be scared by that really intense name. Still, my eyes are irritated and it ’ s annoying. We likely experience computer vision syndrome because we blink less when we stare at a screen.

So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do — remember, these are assumptions — their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don ’ t like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature.

Instead of solely relying on donors year after year, the speaker proposed the idea of creating a mission that can sustain itself financially.######To address these challenges, the speaker shared an interesting approach they took in a food insecure neighborhood. They directly asked the residents what they wanted, and the response was that they desired affordable, tasty, and nutritious food that they could purchase themselves. These individuals emphasized their desire to retain their dignity and not rely solely on handouts or charity.######In conclusion, the lecture highlights the need for a shift in the American food system to prioritize nutrition and affordability, rather than simply focusing on cheap calories. Additionally, it suggests that nonprofits should explore self-sustaining mission models that empower individuals to make their own choices and maintain their dignity while accessing essential resources.",

    "question": "Most people intuitively blame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous undermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily choking under pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers when the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention on performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts compete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process so much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental scratch pad we use to temporarily store phone numbers and grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, a group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex and memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem types with nothing at stake, while the others completed them when calm and under pressure. While everyone did well on the easy problems, those who were stressed performed worse on the more difficult, memory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up the second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They ’ re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze the task at hand. Here, the logic goes that once a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics interferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be most vulnerable to this kind of choking.",

    "question": "There are two major factors that cause food to go bad: microbes and oxidation. Microbes like bacteria and fungi invade food and feed off its nutrients. Some of these can cause diseases, like listeria and botulism. Others just turn edibles into a smelly, slimy, moldy mess. Meanwhile, oxidation is a chemical change in the food ’ s molecules caused by enzymes or free radicals which turn fats rancid and brown produce, like apples and potatoes. Preservatives can prevent both types of deterioration. Before the invention of artificial refrigeration, fungi and bacteria could run rampant in food. So we found ways to create an inhospitable environment for microbes. For example, making the food more acidic unravels enzymes that microbes need to survive. And some types of bacteria can actually help. For thousands of years, people preserved food using bacteria that produce lactic acid. The acid turns perishable vegetables and milk into longer lasting foods, like sauerkraut in Europe, kimchi in Korea, and yogurt in the Middle East. These cultured foods also populate your digestive track with beneficial microbes. Many synthetic preservatives are also acids.

Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere? Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that ’ s causing climate change. But as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, more is dissolving into the oceans. And this is what ’ s changing our ocean chemistry. When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it undergoes a number of chemical reactions. Now lucky for you, I don ’ t have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today, but I ’ ll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean, the seawater pH goes down. And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity. And this whole process is called ocean acidification. And it ’ s happening alongside climate change. Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades. This figure is an important time series in Hawaii, and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, or CO 2 gas, in the atmosphere. And this is directly as a result of human activities. The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean which you can see is increasing at the same rate as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began. The line on the bottom then shows the change in chemistry.

You share similar activities but more importantly: similar schedules. Overlapping and fluctuating social circles form, naturally giving you regular face time and shared experiences with many different people. Time to find others with similar world views or senses of humor. Proximity can be more important than similar interests. One study found that in student dormitories, the distance between rooms was the strongest friendship predictor – living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends.

It contains more than 7, 300 electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth ’ s continents, transmitting electricity around the clock. They ’ re massive feats of engineering, but their functioning depends on a delicate balance. Their components must always work in unison, maintain a constant frequency throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there ’ s too much electricity in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “ dispatch curve, ” which maps out the order in which energy sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are ordered by price.

    "question": "And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, during, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself from tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy building would offer protection from the explosion ’ s shock wave, heat, and radiation. The shock wave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball ’ s radius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should be able to withstand the shock wave, and staying in the centers and basements of these buildings also helps provide protection from heat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important if the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt and debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear fission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term effect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit-ionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from molecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this radiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, cancer, and even death. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer protection from the blast are even better at guarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels through space and mass.

Over time, this therapy can help rebuild neural pathways that regulate the anxiety response.######Furthermore, medication can provide relief for both short-term and long-term anxiety management. Anti-anxiety drugs are capable of reducing the overactive threat-detection mechanisms. Research has shown that both long-term medication usage and cognitive behavioral therapy can decrease the hyperactivity of the amygdala typically observed in anxiety disorders.######Similar to how high blood pressure and diabetes can be treated or managed over time, anxiety disorders can also be addressed through various methods outlined above.",

    "question": "If you actually want to make a difference, you have to do something. And we ’ ve learned there are three key ways: The first is we have to educate for body confidence. We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome image-related pressures and build their self-esteem. Now the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this. The bad news is that most of them don ’ t work. I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning programs are inadvertently actually making the situation worse. So we need to make damn sure that the programs that our kids are receiving are not only having a positive impact, but having a lasting impact as well. And the research shows that the best programs address six key areas: The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships. The second is media and celebrity culture, then how to handle teasing and bullying, the way we compete and compare with one another based on looks, talking about appearance — some people call this “ body talk ” or “ fat talk ” — and finally, the foundations of respecting and looking after yourself. These six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about delivering body-confidence education that works. An education is critical, but tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives.

    "question": "Awe ’ s a powerful and transformative emotion. It ’ s inspired great works of art incited religious movements and generated philosophical musing about the sublime. But despite this impressive resume, only very recently have we begun to study this emotion in psychology. So what is awe? I define it by its synonyms, wonder and amazement, and by its psychological experience. We feel awe when we encounter something vast and grande that challenges our world view. It makes us feel small in the presence of something bigger than ourselves and connected with others around us. Now you may be thinking that you have to travel to remote places in order to experience this emotion, but I can tell you that that ’ s not the case. In fact, participants report feeling awe about twice a week on average, making it a more common emotion than you might expect. We feel awe when we hear beautiful music, when we look up at the night sky and see the stars, or when we watch athletes achieve feats that we thought were beyond reality. So here ’ s the question: why would awe be a better predictor of good health than other positive emotions? We don ’ t yet know. It may be because awe ’ s particular protein at reducing stress or increasing feelings of social connection. It may be because awe generates a desire to engage or explore the world around us. Recent work suggests that awe promotes greater humility, prosociality and well-being. And all of these things could impact physical health.",

The tobacco industry, however, are against this and they in particular argue that the cigarette box is not a form of advertising. Michaela has been doing her PhD looking at cigarette advertising and how it's changed over the last 50 years. Basically, I've accessed advertising from the tobacco industry since the 1950 s and just analyze the images and looked at the use of the cigarette box within the adverts. In the very early adverts, the cigarette box is a very small part of the adverts and they focus much more on the social aspects of smoking. However, as you move through the decades and get closer to the present day, the cigarette box became more and more of a focal point in the adverts. My argument is that the cigarette box has actually become iconic to each brand. So when a smoker takes a box out of their pocket, they are actually advertising that brand. So what we hope will come out of this is that the government will introduce plain packaging. And like Australia who have already introduced its policy and Ireland who are again beginning to introduce its policy, we hope that the UK will stop cigarette companies from using their box as a form of advertising.",

The average American before the pandemic was taking something like 4, 700 and something steps a day. Only about 20% of Americans get the very minimum levels of exercise that every health organization in the world thinks is the minimum for an adult- which is 150 minutes a week. So 80% of us really struggle and fail to get very basic amounts of exercise, but almost everyone says that they want to get enough exercise. We live in a world where we no longer have to be physically active. We now, in a very strange way, have to choose to be physically active, and that ’ s not so easy ’ cause there were no ellipticals and other kinds of machines back in the Stone Age. If you wanna get your heart rate up you probably were running. And one of the biggest myths about running is that it ’ ll destroy your knees. There ’ s tons and tons of studies, more than a dozen randomized, controlled-perspective, gold standard studies, which show that people who run more are not more likely to get arthritis. In fact, lots of research shows that physical activities like running actually cause your joints to repair themselves and to stay healthy.

This suggests that creating a false story about a personal topic takes work and results in a different pattern of language use. A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the subconscious language of deception. First, liars reference themselves less, when making deceptive statements. They write or talk more about others, often using the third person to distance and disassociate themselves from their lie, which sounds more false: “ Absolutely no party took place at this house, ” or “ I didn ’ t host a party here. ” Second, liars tend to be more negative, because on a subconscious level, they feel guilty about lying. For example, a liar might say something like, “ Sorry, my stupid phone battery died. I hate that thing. ” Third, liars typically explain events in simple terms since our brains struggle to build a complex lie. Judgment and evaluation are complex things for our brains to compute. As a U. S. President once famously insisted: “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman. ” And finally, even though liars keep descriptions simple, they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentence structure, inserting unnecessary words and irrelevant but factual sounding details in order to pad the lie.",

    "question": "Work comes to be the center around which the world turns. Human beings start to see themselves chiefly as workers, and the entirety of life becomes more and more work, or work like. To see this we can begin to examine a number of what I might call tightening conditions. So the first condition would be the centrality of work. We ’ ve come to think that work is actually the center and everything else begins to turn around it. That we are preparing for work. That we are preparing to leave work. And this is happening all the way around the world. Meanwhile we ’ re adjusting our schedules, the rest of our lives so that they are turning about it. So that would be the first condition. The second condition is subordination. That everything else in life comes to seem as if it ’ s subordinate to, and to be put in the service of, work. We can think of sleeping: the idea is that we wish to sleep well today in order to be focused and prepared for work. And that when we ’ re at work we wish to be as productive as possible. So sleep becomes that which is an instrument in the service of productivity. And we can play that game with all sorts of different instances. The third condition is the resemblance claim. It seems as if everything else in life comes to resemble work, more and more. So you can think of, on a day off you are wanting to be as productive as possible, thinking about how much you got done. You can begin to think about all the ways in which you plan and schedule time with children. The terms that begin to mark out our lives even when we ’ re not actually working sound more and more work like.

    "question": "Why are there so many jobs? There are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake. One has to do with human genius and creativity. The other has to do with human insatiability, or greed, if you like. I ’ m going to call the first of these the O-ring principle, and it determines the type of work that we do. The second principle is the never-get - enough principle, and it determines how many jobs there actually are. Let ’ s start with the O-ring. ATMs, automated teller machines, had two countervailing effects on bank teller employment. As you would expect, they replaced a lot of teller tasks. The number of tellers per branch fell by about a third. But banks quickly discovered that it also was cheaper to open new branches, and the number of bank branches increased by about 40 percent in the same time period. The net result was more branches and more tellers. But those tellers were doing somewhat different work. As their routine, cash-handling tasks receded, they became less like checkout clerks and more like salespeople, forging relationships with customers, solving problems and introducing them to new products like credit cards, loans and investments: more tellers doing a more cognitively demanding job. There ’ s a general principle here. Most of the work that we do requires a multiplicity of skills, and brains and brawn, technical expertise and intuitive mastery, perspiration and inspiration in the words of Thomas Edison. In general, automating some subset of those tasks doesn ’ t make the other ones unnecessary. In fact, it makes them more important. It increases their economic value.",

In 1967, a man named Alan Frank invented a lid that you could peel a tab off, like in the shape of a guitar pick and drink it from there. In 1975, another big advance, you could peel back a tab and attach it to the lid itself. So more and more people started drinking coffee on the go. In 1984, a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids, the birth of the traveler lid, and it is iconic. You ’ ve seen it a million times, and it solved a whole host of problems. It ’ s designed so that you don ’ t splash your face, because it ’ s higher than any of the other ones. It ’ s got this protruding rim, so it slightly cools the coffee before it hits your lips. It ’ s got a small depression in the center for your nose, so you can really get in there and get maximum aroma. It ’ s got this tiny air hole that lets the steam out and stops it from creating a vacuum. This is one of those objects where you just don ’ t notice it until it dribbles on your lap, so I think the coffee cup lid will just continue to evolve, and you ’ re gonna see a move away from single-use plastic lids to lids that are a little more sustainable.",

    "answer_ai": "The lecture is about the history and evolution of coffee cup lids.######The speaker has highlighted the significant fact that coffee drinking has become increasingly mobile in our society, leading to the invention and improvement of coffee cup lids to accommodate on-the-go consumption. The first patent for a lid on a cup was in 1934, primarily for cold beverages. However, it was in 1950 that James Reifsnyder invented the first snap-on lid, although it did not have an opening for drinking. The 1960s marked a cultural shift with people starting to drink coffee while on the move, and 7-Eleven became the first to sell coffee to go. Alan Frank revolutionized coffee cup lids in 1967 with the invention of a lid that had a peelable tab for drinking. A major advance came in 1975 with the introduction of a lid that had a tab which could be peeled back and attached to the lid itself. This led to a significant increase in coffee consumption on the go. The iconic traveler lid, invented in 1984, marked a watershed moment in the history of coffee cup lids. It solved various problems by preventing splashing, cooling the coffee before it reaches the lips, offering a depression for maximum aroma, and including a tiny air hole to release steam without creating a vacuum. The speaker believes that coffee cup lids will continue to evolve, with a shift towards more sustainable options, moving away from single-use plastic lids. ######In conclusion, the lecture provides a fascinating overview of the history and advancements in coffee cup lids, highlighting their importance in facilitating mobile coffee consumption and the potential for more sustainable designs in the future.",

Are we raising kids who don ’ t know how to dream big dreams? Their biggest goal is getting the next A, or the next test score? And are they carrying this need for constant validation with them into their future lives? Maybe, because employers are coming to me and saying, “ We have already raised a generation of young workers who can ’ t get through the day without an award. ” So what can we do? How can we build that bridge to yet? Here are some things we can do. First of all, we can praise wisely, not praising intelligence or talent. That has failed. Don ’ t do that anymore. But praising the process that kids engage in, their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their improvement. This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient. There are other ways to reward yet. We recently teamed up with game scientists from the University of Washington to create a new online math game that rewarded yet. In this game, students were rewarded for effort, strategy and progress. The usual math game rewards you for getting answers right, right now, but this game rewarded process. And we got more effort, more strategies, more engagement over longer periods of time, and more perseverance when they hit really, really hard problems. Just the words “ yet ” or “ not yet, ” we ’ re finding, give kids greater confidence. Give them a path into the future that creates greater persistence.

Once the odor receptors are triggered by these smell molecules, the neurons send information about them to the brain. Here ’ s what I think is so cool. The brain not only categorizes that information as a particular odor, it may also begin to associate feelings like pleasure or disgust and other moods and emotions with that odor for future reference. For example, you sniff bacon. You eat it. Your taste buds get salt, and then your body gets a whack of fat, which is an energy source. So the brain loves it and attaches a positive label to it.

A closed system is a system in which no matter or energy is allowed to enter or leave. The first law of thermodynamics tells us that the amount of energy within an ecosystem is constant.

We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room, that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully about things that have been happening in our lives, that it depends on a jokey manner and ideally on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences. But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. Firstly, true sociability that is a real connection between two people is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing some of what is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing in an uncensored and frank way a little of the agony and confusion of being alive. Secondly, true sociability requires a context. We are generally under such pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, we are understandably uninclined spontaneously to disclose our true selves.

    "question": "The sensation of fullness is set in motion as food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach, it gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding muscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped intricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve up to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain that control food intake. But that ’ s just one input your brain uses to sense fullness. After all, if you fill your stomach with water, you won ’ t feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account chemical messengers in the form of hormones produced by endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific nutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase as you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, they ’ re swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus in the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones are involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food by cells in the upper small bowel.

    "question": "How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, fish stick together in groups, but that ’ s not just because they enjoy each other ’ s company. It ’ s a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close to your neighbor, and two, keep swimming. As individuals, the fish are focused on the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group, something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own unique set of behaviors. The school isn ’ t controlled by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish following the right set of local rules. It ’ s like an accident that happens over and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean to reliably avoid predation.",

For the many millions experiencing bipolar disorder around the world, life is split between two different realities – elation and depression. Although there are many variations of bipolar disorder, let ’ s consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs alongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, less extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods of depression. For someone seesawing between emotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance necessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1' s extreme highs are known as manic episodes, and they can make a person range from feeling irritable to invincible.

They live in Australia, New Guinea and the nearby islands. Also everyone knows that kangaroo females have a special pouch where they carry their cubs. But not everyone knows that a kangaroo has a very short of pregnancy term. A baby is born about a month after conception. However, this is not a grown animal ready for life in the outside world. The size of a new-born kangaroo is only a couple of centimeters. And it weighs about a gram. In this embryonic state, the cub makes its way into the pouch, and a tiny kangaroo does not yet have hind legs, so he has to use the front ones. Moreover, the mother does not help him. She only licks the path to the pouch, for the cub immediately starts sucking on the nipple. Well, he doesn ’ t actually suck it, because he is not yet able to. He is too small. Milk is secreted into his mouth with the help of a special muscle. Another particular thing about the kangaroo is that it has four nipples in his pouch. And each of them secretes a different kind of milk. So, kangaroos have four times of milk depending on the age of the cub. Sometimes a female has two cubs of different ages at once, and both are still in the pouch. In this case, two kinds of milks are secreted. In about 190 days, the cub becomes large and strong enough to climb out of the pouch. At first, he only sticks his head out. And this can continue for several weeks, until the cub feels safe enough to get out. He then starts spending more and more time in the outside world.

    "question": "One of the most striking properties about life is that it has color. To understand the phenomenon of color, it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that, let ’ s talk a little bit about waves in general. Imagine you ’ re sitting on a boat on the ocean watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about the motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and over again … up and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion is characteristic of waves. Then you notice something else … using a stopwatch, you measure the time it takes for the piece of cork to go over its highest position down to its lowest and then back up again. Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you ’ ve measured the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go through its full range of motion once. The same information can be expressed in a different way by calculating the wave ’ s frequency. Frequency, as the name suggests, tells you how frequent the waves are. That is, how many of them go by in one second. If you know how many seconds one full wave takes, then it ’ s easy to work out how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds, the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing corks … what about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must have a frequency. Right? Well … yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It ’ s called color. That ’ s right.

In the early 1900 s, Sigmund Freud proposed that while all of our dreams, including our nightmares, are a collection of images from our daily conscious lives, they also have symbolic meanings, which relate to the fulfillment of our subconscious wishes. Freud theorized that everything we remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thoughts, urges, and desires. Freud believed that by analyzing those remembered elements, the unconscious content would be revealed to our conscious mind, and psychological issues stemming from its repression could be addressed and resolved. We dream to remember. To increase performance on certain mental tasks, sleep is good, but dreaming while sleeping is better. In 2010, researchers found that subjects were much better at getting through a complex 3- D maze if they had napped and dreamed of the maze prior to their second attempt. In fact, they were up to ten times better at it than those who only thought of the maze while awake between attempts, and those who napped but did not dream about the maze.

When a dominant or aggressive opponent is threatening them, they'll show off their teeth as a signal that they don't want any trouble. In other primates, including some macaques and baboons, the same toothy expression shows up while the monkeys are greeting, grooming, and embracing each other. And one of our closest cousins, chimpanzees, show a clear connection between the silent bared-teeth expression and social bonding: the more they flash their teeth at each other, the better they get along.

    "question": "Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through a process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter a new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates a unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences associated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening synaptic connections stimulated during the original sensory experience. Once memory has been encoded, it can be remembered or retrieved later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it ’ s likely the prefrontal cortexthat signals for their retrieval. So how does stress affect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually help experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones known as corticosteroids, which activate a process of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing experience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood of corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation.

    "question": "Most of the world ’ s ecosystems are the result of millennia of coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment and each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance via limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict the size or range of a species. These include things like natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends on levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects the population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores that feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps the herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor can upset this balance, and the sudden introduction of non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved in a separate habitat will be susceptible to different limiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat ’ s limiting factors fail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms for resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem.

    "question": "You see, camels are one of the only animals in the world that store all their fat in one spot. And that ’ s useful for keeping cool in a hot climate because heat can escape faster from the rest of their body, which helps them maintain a lower body temperature. Compare that to other mammals, like humans, who store fat all over, making it a lot harder to stay cool. Today, camels still use the fat in their humps as a food reserve, but they ’ re not the only ones. In extreme circumstances, the Turkana tribe in Kenya, for example will eat camel fat to survive. They suffer a lot from periods of extreme drought, and I have seen these people, they ’ ve been very, very short on food, and this is difficult to believe, but it ’ s true, slit open the top of a camel ’ s hump, take out the fat for their own consumption, and then put the top of the hump back on again. But don ’ t worry, the camel makes a full recovery and instances are rare. But this practice has started to generate some buzz around camel fat as a new superfood.

    "question": "Airlines can make a lot of money by flying to the right places. British Airways, for example, long-ago cemented themselves as the leader on the London Heathrow to New York JKF route, and flying between these two airports now earns them over $1 billion per year. That ’ s more than any airline makes on any other route in the world. Conversely, though, airlines can lose a lot of money by flying to the wrong places. American Airlines, for example, recently cancelled their Chicago to Beijing flight as it was loosing them tens of millions of dollars per year. Now, the fact that this route failed might be puzzling considering it flew between the world ’ s fiftieth and the world seventh largest city. Even more, they were flying the 787-8 Dreamliner, the smallest plane they could on this route. Nonetheless, it was truly a financial disaster. The airline said that, in terms of annual revenue, the route was $ 80 million away from their target. The truth is that deciding where to fly is a lot more complicated than pairing up the largest cities.

These are some of the big questions facing marine conservation biologists today. Let ’ s take Fiji, for example. Fiji is series of islands in the South Pacific Ocean. To help balance the need for conservation and making a living, scientists had suggested that instead of one big park which provides a lot of coverage for one reef system while leaving the rest unprotected, a better way is to create a system of protected areas nested together like pearls on a string. This idea is called connectivity. In this way, scientists can protect lots of different habitats while not excluding people from their traditional fishing grounds.

    "question": "Hair loss can be a sensitive topic for a lot of people. While certain life events and old age can lead to hair loss, sometimes it can be caused by a health condition. One such condition is alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is a condition that can cause your hair to fall out more than normal. The average person can pretty easily lose up to around 100 pieces of hair a day from their scalp with most of that growing back. Alopecia areata is when that hair loss gets more significant and you have trouble getting that hair to grow back. The amount of hair that falls out varies from person to person, but it can be anything from small, rather unnoticeable patches, to greater amounts of hair loss as the patches increase in size and connect with each other. We often think of this as hair loss relating to what ’ s on top of your head, but this condition can also include hair loss in places like your eyebrows and eyelashes, as well as your face and other parts of your body. According to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation, this condition is fairly common, affecting as many as 6.8 million Americans with a lifetime risk of 2.1%. While there is no cure, symptoms can come and go. It might develop slowly, then go away for a few years before coming back. Alopecia areata can lead to alopecia totalis, where you lose all of the hair on your scalp, or alopecia universalis, where you have total hair loss. Generally, when and if your hair ever does grow back, it might fall out again later on. It often first shows up with children, but can begin in any age group.",

While there is no cure for this condition, its symptoms can come and go, and it may develop slowly, go into remission for several years, and then reoccur. Alopecia areata can progress to alopecia totalis (complete hair loss on the scalp) or alopecia universalis (total hair loss throughout the body). Moreover, even if hair regrowth occurs, it is possible for the hair to fall out again later on. While it often first appears in children, alopecia areata can manifest at any age.######In conclusion, alopecia areata is a condition that can cause noticeable hair loss and can affect various parts of the body.

    "question": "Genie spent the first 13 years of her life locked away in a small bedroom in her parents ’ home. In 1970, her parents were charged with child abuse and Genie began rehabilitation with a team of psychologists and linguists. And scientists were using her experiences to answer the following question: if a person is deprived of language throughout their childhood, can they ever learn enough to be able to communicate well? At first, the answer appeared to be yes. Genie quickly began to learn new words for the objects around her and even say phrases with two or three words similar to how toddlers speak. However, from there, her ability to communicate verbally plateaued. This is because she could not learn grammar, which linguist Noam Chomsky believes separates human language from the communication of animals. It appeared that Genie had passed the critical period of learning human language, which is thought to end around puberty. Scientists have hypothesized that, after a restricted developmental period where the nervous system is particularly sensitive to the effects of a certain experience, in this case, language, it is nearly impossible to learn it. And the same effects have also been shown when learning sign language after the critical period. Now you ’ re probably wondering why there is a critical period in the first place. According to Eric Lenneberg, the linguist who popularized the critical period hypothesis, the function of language tends to settle in the left hemisphere of the brain after the critical period. And it ’ s thought that the brain loses some of its plasticity after this lateralization. So, if you haven ’ t learned language until after this point, it may be harder for your brain to learn the new material. And sadly for Genie, she was already past that point. However, while Genie would never be able to effectively use language, she was able to quickly learn other things, such as how to use the toilet and dress herself.",

There are people who don ’ t feel pain. Now, that might sound cool, but it ’ s not. If you can ’ t feel pain, you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself and never know it. Pain is your body ’ s early warning system. It protects you from the world around you, and from yourself. As we grow, we install pain detectors in most areas of our body.

But, unlike other nerve cells, nociceptors only fire if something happens that could cause or is causing damage. So, gently touch the tip of a needle. You ’ ll feel the metal, and those are your regular nerve cells. But you won ’ t feel any pain. Now, the harder you push against the needle, the closer you get to the nociceptor threshold.

    "question": "The fat stored in your adipose tissue is a super energy-rich substance that your body can use in a pinch to fuel your cells. If you can ’ t eat for whatever reason, or you just need a little extra energy to grow or reproduce, your body can turn to your fat, which is why from a survival perspective, having some fat is actually a good thing! Still you ’ d think that losing weight would be pretty straightforward just eat less than you need, and force your body use up some of its fat, then go back to eating a normal amount when you ’ re the size you want to be. But the body doesn ’ t want to lose its energy buffer no matter how large or small it is, so when you cut calories, it reacts in ways that ultimately make it harder to lose weight. A lot of the push back is driven by changes to hormones. One of the most important is leptin, a hormone secreted by your fat cells. The larger your fat cells are, the more leptin they produce. So when you lose weight, leptin levels drop. Parts of your brain like your hypothalamus interpret less leptin as starvation, and it jumps in and starts telling your body to conserve energy and to eat more to rebuild those reserves. Other organs also use hormones to complain to your brain about the decrease in fuel intake. Your stomach tells your brain it ’ s not getting filled by increasing levels of the hormone ghrelin. At the same time, your pancreas secretes less insulin, which regulates blood sugar and amylin, which signals fullness. So when you cut calories, ghrelin levels rise and insulin and amylin levels plummet, signaling your brain to increase appetite, making you feel ravenous.",

    "question": "Most of us learn to speak at such an early age that we don ’ t even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward pronunciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries to understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones is known as descriptivism. Rather than deciding how language should be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations they come up with in the process. But while the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its best, prescriptivism is useful for informing people about the most common established patterns at a given point in time. This is important, not only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier between non-native speakers from different backgrounds. Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we structure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best thought of as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated and reinvented by the entire group of language users.",

    "question": "So how do companies and investors use the market today? Let ’ s imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company ’ s initial public offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the official public market, where any company or individual who believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock. Buying stocks makes those investors partial owners in the business. Their investment helps the company to grow and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing the cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company ’ s stocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people are willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason the company starts to seem less profitable, the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock value is going to decline, they ’ ll sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand for the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company ’ s market value.

    "question": "So why doesn ’ t the Fed just decide to print infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the bills wouldn ’ t be worth anything. Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged for goods and services. If the total amount of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value of goods and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller portion of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the money supply remains the same, while more goods and services are produced, each dollar ’ s value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation means that the money in your wallet today will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to spend it right away. So while this would stimulate business, it would also encourage overconsumption, or hoarding commodities, like food and fuel, raising their prices and leading to consumer shortages and even more inflation. But deflation would make people want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business profits, leading to more unemployment and a further decrease in spending, causing the economy to keep shrinking. So most economists believe that while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent amount of inflation is necessary to encourage economic growth.",

However, for whatever reason, not many people have been since informed about it. So here is the basics of what you need to know.

Normally this evolutionary design works pretty well. With the coming of night and day, our melatonin levels waxes and wanes giving us a circadian rhythm. However since the invention of artificial lights, we ’ re being exposed to more and more light at night time and these effects can be pretty big. Here ’ s what happens when you place participants in a room with similar brightness to your average household.

In an older study with a similar design, participants did lose weight, but only about a third of a pound each week, which McDonald says isn ’ t much. But if not for weight loss, what about using cider vinegar to whiten your teeth? I caution people against that. That ’ s because cider vinegar is an acid.

    "question": "And as Great Britain grew, interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee and the plant was still only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world ’ s fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipments of opium as a statement against Britain ’ s influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms.

Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on just about any form, it ’ s weak and soft. So wouldn ’ t it be nice if there were one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists and technologists are getting excited about a relatively recent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque, like metals, and also like metals, they conduct heat and electricity. But they ’ re way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand a lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also have an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect for sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They ’ re resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes with mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step.

To find out how hibernators are able to do this, researchers turned their attention to those animal ’ s genomes. So far, they ’ ve discovered that hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator ’ s physiology and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use their fat stores as fuel to survive long periods of fasting. And the genes in question are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments for protecting the brain during a stroke.

    "question": "What is consciousness? Can an artificial machine really think? Does the mind just consist of neurons in the brain, or is there some intangible spark at its core? For many, these have been vital considerations for the future of artificial intelligence. But British computer scientist Alan Turing decided to disregard all these questions in favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring artificial intelligence that would famously come to be known as the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, “ Computing Machinery and Intelligence, ” Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must be able to replace one of the players without substantially changing the results. In other words, a computer would be considered intelligent if its conversation couldn ’ t be easily distinguished from a human ’ s. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory would be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun.

This built-in sun shield helped protect them from melanoma and enhanced their evolutionary fitness, allowing them to pass on this advantageous trait to future generations.######In conclusion, our ancestors relied on melanin to protect themselves from harmful UV rays in the absence of sunscreen. Their adaptation to higher melanin production and darker skin tones helped them survive in Sun-saturated environments and ensured the passing on of this beneficial trait.",

    "question": "In the late 17 th century, a medical student named Johannes Hofer noticed a strange illness affecting Swiss mercenaries serving abroad. Its symptoms, including fatigue, insomnia, irregular heartbeat, indigestion, and fever were so strong, the soldiers often had to be discharged. As Hofer discovered, the cause was not some physical disturbance, but an intense yearning for their mountain homeland. He dubbed the condition nostalgia, from the Greek “ nostos ” for homecoming and “ algos ” for pain or longing. At first, nostalgia was considered a particularly Swiss affliction. Some doctors proposed that the constant sound of cowbells in the Alps caused trauma to the ear drums and brain. Commanders even forbade their soldiers from singing traditional Swiss songs for fear that they ’ d lead to desertion or suicide. But as migration increased worldwide, nostalgia was observed in various groups. It turned out that anyone separated from their native place for a long time was vulnerable to nostalgia. And by the early 20 th century, professionals no longer viewed it as a neurological disease, but as a mental condition similar to depression.",

    "question": "The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50 % of top hitters in baseball have been left-handed. Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority to begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time encountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles of evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears. If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset.

The topography of the ocean floor and the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into two main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent of the ocean ’ s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize the other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents influence each other in an intricate dance that keeps the entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven by both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth as the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the major force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers of water along with it.

    "question": "As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheese-making almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, fats, and minerals. But it also contained high quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese however, could provide all of milk ’ s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines and long winters.",

When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said that they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information from one context — an image they ’ d seen — onto another — a memory of something they believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown an image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw the magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects to the correct context — whether they actually saw them, or simply imagined them.",

    "question": "The group of artists who are considered Abstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman with his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous for his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, who created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential, and head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings are immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes of lines of paint bouncing around in every direction on the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big and impressive, but what ’ s so great about them? Didn ’ t he just drip the paint at random? Can ’ t anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions is both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique anyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work ’ s roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings of Andr é Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew directly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden within their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing something and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures that appeared in the scribbles.",

    "question": "One evidence-based way to better remember what you ’ ve learned is through Spaced Repetition, or spacing out your learning and practice of new knowledge or skills. Although this might seem novel, this is hardly a new concept; it was first described in 1885 by a German psychologist named Herman Ebbinghaus. Here ’ s how it works. Say you plot your retention, or how much you remember of something, vs. time. Now you learn that something on day 0. Without reviewing it, the “ forgetting curve ” will look like an exponentially decaying curve, which is kind of scary! If you review ( or better yet actively retrieve ) the material at increasingly spaced intervals after learning it, then the forgetting curve starts to flatten out and you ’ ll get a lot better longer-term retention. Now, the goal here is to review the material at the right time. It turns out that the best time to revisit information that you are trying to learn is right around the time you would naturally forget it. Since forgetting typically follows this exponential curve, the trick becomes timing your study sessions around it. Practically, this means having more widely spaced intervals between study times for the material that you are more familiar with, and shorter intervals between study sessions for material that you are less familiar with.",

    "question": "Montessori Education is based on the principles developed by Maria Montessori, who opened her first school for children of low-income workers in an apartment building in Rome in 1907. The school was called “ Casa dei Bambini ”, Home for Children. This first “ Casa ” was furnished with a teachers table, a stove, a blackboard, some chairs, group tables for the children and a cabinet filled with materials that Montessori developed in her earlier career when she researched how to teach kids who experience some form of mental disability. Maria Montessori created the materials after she realized that students seem to understand complex concepts better when they engaged all their senses. Activities at this first school included personal care, such as dressing and undressing, care of the environment like sweeping, dusting and gardening. Otherwise they were free to move around and play with the materials. Montessori did not teach herself but instead oversaw the classroom work of her teachers. Montessori observed that children showed episodes of deep concentration and multiple repetitions of the same activity. Given free choice, kids showed more interest in practical activities and the materials than normal toys, sweets or other rewards. Over time spontaneous self-discipline emerged. Montessori concluded that working independently children seemed to reach new levels of autonomy and become self-motivated learners. She began to see the role of the teacher as a facilitator of young human beings who are free to move and act within the limits of a prepared environment. The goal: to grow children to become independent and responsible adults who share a love for learning.",

    "question": "English philosopher John Locke gives us a pretty standard way to map out boundaries of intuition. So that ’ s where we ’ ll start. Locke contrasts intuition to sensory perception on one side and to demonstration on the other. Sensory perception, he notices, is always about particular things. You see this pizza in front of you right now. Maybe you see that this pizza is round. But we aren ’ t restricted to making judgements about particular things. When we judge that “ No round things are square ”, we aren ’ t just thinking about that particular pizza, but about a more general and abstract truth. Judging that circles are different from squares, according to Locke, is intuitive. And at least in this kind of case where Locke thinks we ’ re recognizing features of our ideas, intuition is a perfectly good source of knowledge. We know that no round things are square through intuition. Locke also draws a contrast between intuition and demonstration. Intuition can tell us directly that a circle is not a triangle. But when we get to more complex questions, we need to use demonstration or explicit reasoning. So for example, we can figure out that the interior angles of a triangle add up to two right angles, but we have to go through a series of steps to gain this knowledge. And that ’ s demonstration. Demonstration requires conscious stages. Intuition is immediate. Locke notices that intuition and demonstration are connected, however.

    "question": "During the time when the church controlled what people could believe, and the kings ruled over what people ought to own, John Locke, an English doctor, popularized three ideas that changed society and parenting forever. First, people keep fighting over their beliefs, because nobody can actually know which one is true. To solve this problem, everyone should have freedom of thought and the right to choose their own religion. Second, kings can ’ t just do as they please, because people have natural rights to liberty, property and life, and hence need to be asked for permission. Third, parents should avoid punishing their children, since the use of emotions to make them behave well can make them sensationalist. Instead, they should allow their children to be guided by thoughts. Locke ’ s idea on religion and democracy became the foundation of most liberal societies. His thoughts on education, however, may have been even more influential. Locke understood that most people doubt new ideas, without any other apparent reason than them being uncommon.

Although feelings of ownership emerge early in life, culture also plays a part.

That's possibly because they live in an egalitarian society where almost everything is shared. At the other extreme, sometimes our attachment to our things can go too far.

Dumping crazy amounts of water on a forest fire is one pretty effective approach. Water does a couple big things. First, water interferes with that combustion reaction because as it vaporizes it creates a layer of water vapor that separates the fire ’ s fuel from the atmospheric oxygen that it needs to keep going. Second, the water cools the fuel, which slows and ultimately extinguishes the reaction. During a forest fire, firefighters work quickly to put out anything ablaze, including embers, which can fly around and spread the fire. They spray water from the ground and sky, refilling tanks at nearby water sources like lakes, rivers, or even your family ’ s pool. At the same time crews are creating a fire break, which is exactly what it sounds like — a break between the fire and its fuel. But dumping water and cutting down forest often isn ’ t enough.

Water will come in and fill the gaps you create, which will make it easier for you to move and pull your body towards the surface. If you can, grab a stick and wedge it underneath your back; this will help to increase your leverage. Hopefully, you ’ ll get help from emergency services. But if not, you can use these tips to get out on your own. It will be a long and exhausting process since, just to free your foot from a puddle of quicksand, moving at a rate of one centimeter per second, it would require the same amount of force as it does to lift a small car. And once you ’ re free, you ’ ll probably be in a lot of pain. With all that pressure from the densely packed sand, you might emerge in the quicksand with permament nerve damage, or without a leg. If you do manage to come out in one piece, well, maybe tread a little more carefully in the future. But don ’ t let this one sucky experience keep you from another adventure.

For me, I ’ m thinking maybe something about social media. Step 2, do some preliminary reading about the topic. Ok, so I ’ ve read a lot of newspaper writing about how social media negatively impacts high school students ’ academic performances. And they also happen to be one of the most active age groups on social media. Step 3, narrow down to a specific niche. This way, you can make sure the research is within a feasible scope instead of something too broad to achieve in a given timeframe. Since academic performance is too broad, let me narrow it down to attention span. Step 4, identify a research problem. So we have already established that adolescences are one of the most active age groups on social media platforms. But only a scarce amount of research has been done on the effect of social media has on the younger generation ’ s attention span. So this will be my research problem. Step 5, write your research question! Turning your research problem into a question, and it sounds something like: What effect does daily use of Twitter have on the attention span of people in the age group of 16 to 20? Since this is the descriptive research, the research question is also descriptive. But there are also other kinds of research questions, it all depends on the type of research you ’ ll do.

    "question": "Essentially when the brain sees something that ’ s novel, it has to burn more energy to represent it because it wasn ’ t expecting that. This feeling that things are going in slow motion is a trick of memory. In other words, when you ’ re in an emergency situation a part of the brain called the amygdala comes online, this is your emergency control centre, it lays down memories on what amounts to a secondary memory track, these are very dense memories. And you ’ re noticing everything around you and writing it all down. So when the brain reads that back out, there ’ s such a density of memory there that the brain ’ s only conclusion is that must have taken a long time. And I think this offers an explanation for why people think that time seems to speed up as they grow older. And it ’ s because when you ’ re a child, everything ’ s new to you. You ’ re figuring out the rules of the world, you ’ re writing down a lot of memory, and so when you look back at the end of a year, you have a lot of memory of what you ’ ve learnt.

Additionally, the brain's amygdala plays a role in emergency situations, laying down dense memories which can contribute to the perception of time seeming to slow down.######In conclusion, the speaker suggests that the perception of time speeding up as we grow older may be due to the fact that as children, we are constantly experiencing new things and forming rich memories.

There's evidence that language involves some kind of image simulation and that that has a consequence for how we perceive of certain events. Color is quite a complex property of a visual world. Your brain is decoding color in quite a complicated way. So you have many languages that have a term to denote both green and blue and typically we call this a ' grue' term. You find this in languages like the Himba, for example, in the Namibian plains. In this experiment, we asked participants to look at the color tile and then after 30 seconds we show them the full array of colors and we say, \" Now, pick the one that you just saw. \" And it's a very difficult task if you're an English speaker but a Himba speaker can do it like child's play because that color is central to them.

Can I share them with you? ” This micro-yes question does two things for you. First of all, it ’ s going to be a pacing tool. It lets the other person know that feedback is about to be given. And the second thing it does is it creates a moment of buy-in. I can say yes or no to that yes or no question. And with that, I get a feeling of autonomy. The second part of the feedback formula is going to be giving your data point. Here, you should name specifically what you saw or heard, and cut out any words that aren ’ t objective.

But there ’ s a second sense in which the psychological consequences of poverty might exacerbate poverty. And that is that they may simply incapacitate you. So when chronic stress turns into full-fledged clinical depression, it ’ s very hard for people to keep earning a living. So you don ’ t think your efforts will amount to anything. You know no amount of information about returns to education can convince you otherwise. It ’ s hard for you to even get out of bed in the morning and your livelihood crumbles. So this is bad enough when you ’ re wealthy, but it ’ s worse when you ’ re poor. And you don ’ t have as much of a safety net to fall back on. So as a result of this, there ’ s a silent epidemic of depression among the poor. And that ’ s the problem not only for psychological well-being, but also for economic outcomes.",

    "question": "We may think of nature as being unconnected to our urban spaces, but trees have always been an essential part of successful cities. Trees act like a natural sponge, absorbing storm water runoff before releasing it back into the atmosphere. The webs of their roots protect against mudslides while allowing soil to retain water and filter out toxins. Roots help prevent floods, while reducing the need for storm drains and water treatment plants. Their porous leaves purify the air by trapping carbon and other pollutants, making them essential in the fight against climate change. Humanity has been uncovering these arboreal benefits for centuries. But trees aren ’ t just crucial to the health of a city ’ s infrastructure; they play a vital role in the health of its citizens as well. In the 1870’ s, Manhattan had few trees outside the island ’ s parks. Without trees to provide shade, buildings absorbed up to nine times more solar radiation during deadly summer heat waves. Combined with the period ’ s poor sanitation standards, the oppressive heat made the city a breeding ground for bacteria like cholera.",

For example, don ’ t start mowing your lawn at 7: 00 a. m. on a Saturday morning. Your neighbors will thank you. Or use a rake instead of a leaf blower. In general, noise reduction at the source makes the most sense. So whenever you ’ re looking to buy a new car, air conditioning unit, blender, you name it, make low noise a priority. Many manufacturers will list the noise levels the devices generate, and some even advertise with them. Use that information. Many people think that stronger noise regulation and enforcement are good ideas, even obvious solutions perhaps. But it ’ s not as easy as you may think, because many of the activities that generate noise also generate revenue. Think about an airport and all the business that is associated with it.

While other carbs are broken down into sugars, fiber passes by sort of moseying along, doing all kinds of cool things. High-fiber foods physically take longer to eat, so they help us pace our meals. The bulk also slows down digestion, especially in the stomach, and makes you feel full longer. Fiber also draws water into the stool, keeping it soft. Scratchy, hard stool is, to put it mildly, unpleasant. It also increases bacterial mass. The water and bacteria together increase the bulk of the stool, which helps it move along. Fiber also slows absorption of sugars into the bloodstream and reduces absorption of fats and cholesterols. And as fiber collects in your colon, it feeds all your good gut bacteria, helping you maintain a healthy microbiome.

Shorty after it was immortalized in the Bond film of the same name. What the slogan did was create the concept that a diamond ring would be kept by the betrothed for eternity, creating a special sentiment but also meaning fewer would be re-sold, therefore increasing the chance for De Beers to sell more, freshly mined stones. Ayer's copywriters were also skilled in directing consumer spending habits suggesting a month ’ s salary was a good amount to spend on a ring, then upping it to two by the 1980 s. Before the second world war, 10% of engagement rings contained diamonds. By the 1980 s the number was up to 80%. Over the same period diamond sales in the United States grew from $23 million to $2.1 billion. De Beers and N. W.

This slogan solidified the association between diamonds and eternal love. Gerety's work on De Beers campaigns continued until 1970, and the slogan was immortalized in the James Bond film of the same name. The creation of this slogan influenced consumers to view diamond rings as a symbol of eternal commitment, leading to fewer resales and increasing the demand for freshly mined stones.######Furthermore, the speaker mentioned that Ayer's copywriters effectively directed consumer spending habits by suggesting an appropriate amount to spend on an engagement ring. Initially, they proposed a month's salary, but eventually increased it to two by the 1980s.

    "question": "For centuries, boys were top of the class. But these days, that ’ s no longer the case. A new study by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, examined how 15- year-old boys and girls performed at reading, mathematics, and science. Boys still score somewhat better at maths, and in science the genders are roughly equal. But when it comes to the students who really struggle, the difference is stark: boys are 50% more likely than girls to fall short of basic standards in all three areas. Researchers suggest that doing homework set by teachers is linked to better performance in maths, reading, and science. Boys, it appears, spend more of their free time in the virtual world; they are 17% more likely than girls to play collaborative online games than girls every day. They also use the internet more. Third, peer pressure plays a role. A lot of boys decide early on that they are just too cool for school which means they ’ re more likely to be rowdy in class. Teachers mark them down for this. In anonymous tests, boys perform better. In fact, the gender gap in reading drops by a third when teachers don ’ t know the gender of the pupil they are marking. So what can be done to close this gap? Getting boys to do more homework and cut down on screen-time would help. . But most of all, abandoning gender stereotypes would benefit all students. Boys in countries with the best schools read much better than girls. And girls in Shanghai excel in mathematics. They outperform boys from anywhere else in the world.",

    "answer_ai": "The lecture is about the gender gap in academic performance and the factors contributing to it.######The speaker has highlighted the significant fact that boys are no longer consistently outperforming girls in academics. According to a study by the OECD, while boys still score slightly better in math, girls are excelling in reading and there is equality in science. However, boys are 50% more likely to fall short of basic standards in all three areas, indicating a significant disparity in struggling students between genders.######Furthermore, the speaker discusses the potential reasons for this gap. One factor is the differences in how boys and girls spend their free time. Boys tend to spend more time in the virtual world, playing collaborative online games and using the internet more, which may detract from their academic performance. Another factor is peer pressure, with boys being more prone to considering school as uncool and displaying rowdy behavior in class. Teachers tend to mark them down for this, despite their better performance in anonymous tests.######In conclusion, the speaker suggests several actions that can be taken to address this gender gap. Encouraging boys to do more homework and reducing their screen time may help improve their academic performance. However, the most crucial aspect is abandoning gender stereotypes. The best-performing boys in countries with top schools have shown exceptional reading skills, while girls in Shanghai excel in mathematics. By challenging preconceived notions of gender abilities, all students can benefit from a more inclusive and equal education system.",

For many people, language acquisition starts around about twelve months when kids say that first word, but don't forget the first year. At the first year, our first year of life is very important as well and indeed before you are born, remember there are couple of months before you are born, when you actually able to perceive in the womb, something of the language that's around you. So language acquisition starts earlier than most people think. And it also ends later than most people think. When does child language acquisition stop? Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is no obvious endpoint for learning sounds, of course, there is for learning grammar, there is for vocabulary, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English. Most of us only have a vocabulary of 50, 60, 70 thousand words, whatever it is until there is always something to learn.

    "question": "There comes a time in a desert ant's life when a piece of food is too large to ignore, but too heavy to lift, and the only way to get it home is to adopt a new style of walking. The long-legged and speedy Cataglyphis fortis normally covers ground with a three-legged stride that moves two legs forwards on one side, and one on the other. For the next step, the insect mirrors the move with its other three legs. But recordings of ants in the Tunisian desert reveal that when faced with oversized lumps of food 10 times their own weight, the forward ' tripod' walking style is abandoned. Unable to lift the morsels in their mandibles, the ants drag the food backwards instead, moving all six legs independently. \" This is the first time we have seen this in any ants, \" said lead author Sarah Pfeffer at the University of Ulm in Germany. The ants' long legs already help keep their bodies away from the scorching desert floor and enable them to speed around at up to 60 cm per second. \" Think of Usain Bolt, who has very long legs compared to body size. The desert floor is also very hot, so the further away their bodies are from the surface, the better, \" said co-author Matthias Wittlinger. The ants have also evolved to function at body temperatures of 50 C in a desert where temperatures can soar to 70 C. \" They ’ re basically just trying to get out of the heat, \" he added.",

    "question": "Most Americans take energy for granted. But, for many families, maintaining access to reliable and affordable energy is a persistent challenge and a significant material hardship. This is a problem referred to as energy insecurity, and it affects millions of American households each year. We have found that energy insecurity is a growing and vexing problem among low-income households, and the COVID- 19 pandemic has made this problem worse. Our analysis finds that there are disparities in rates of energy insecurity across various socio-demographic groups. Black and Hispanic households, for example, are significantly more likely to experience energy insecurity and face utility disconnection than white households. So too are households with young children, individuals that require electronic medical devices, and those in dwellings with inefficient or poor conditions. Households that cannot pay for energy are unable to power electronic learning or medical devices, keep perishable, healthy food in the refrigerator, or maintain safe body temperatures. Under conditions of extreme heat or cold, people can suffer from mental and physical health consequences, including the possibility of death. Strategies for coping with uncomfortable temperatures, such as burning trash or sitting in one's car with the heat running, can lead to tragic outcomes as well. Our research underscores the importance of public policy that targets energy insecurity and its underlying causes. Weatherization assistance, incentives for residential solar power, energy bill assistance, and utility disconnection protections are all viable strategies for helping the millions of households across the country that are currently unable to pay their energy bills.",

Autocrats have a keen interest in promoting the idea that they are all powerful. Whereas leaders in democracies can be removed via elections, leaders in autocracies can lose office in two ways: via a coup or popular revolt. To make matters worse, autocrats can rarely address both threats at the same time. They often have to choose whether to reward their elite cronies to prevent a coup or the masses to prevent a revolt. This generates many difficult tradeoffs. Cheat too little on elections and risk losing office, but cheat too much and signal weakness to your opponents. Use corruption to reward your elite friends, but not so much that it slows economic growth and sparks a revolt. Manipulate the media, but not so much that people turn off the television.

    "question": "Are you a chocolate-lover? Even true chocoholics might not know what their favorite treat has in common with yogurt, cheese, and wine: its flavors come from fermentation. Fermentation is the process of improving a food through the controlled activity of microbes. The food you know as chocolate starts its life as the seeds of football-shaped fruit. Farmers scoop out the seeds and pulp into piles or boxes. The seeds are now called \" cacao beans \". They ferment for about a week before they're dried, roasted, and crushed with sugar until smooth and ready to eat. Let's go back to that fermentation step. Cacao fermentation is a multi-stage process. The first stage involves yeast. Just like the yeast in your beer, yeast in a cacao fermentation produces alcohol by digesting the sugary pulp around the beans. As the pulp breaks down, oxygen seeps in. And oxygen-loving bacteria take over. The bacteria generate acetic acid from the alcohol that the yeast produced. Acetic acid causes biochemical changes as it soaks into the beans, and that has a major impact on flavor. Finally, as the acid slowly evaporates and the sugars are all used up, spore-forming organisms begin to grow. Cacao is a wild fermentation. Farmers rely on natural microbes in their environment to create unique, local flavors.",

By coating photographic plates with a light-sensitive material and using the telescope as a camera, astronomers can capture and study faint objects that would be too dim to see just by looking through a telescope.######In conclusion, the lecture emphasizes that while the common perception is that astronomers spend their time peering through telescopes every night, the reality is that they spend most of their time analyzing data. The use of photography as a tool for observing the skies allows for the capture of faint objects that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.",

    "question": "Nikola Tesla, living under the shadow of Thomas Edison. Tesla is less alone, but his theories have given him a special place in the field. Here we try to showcase some interesting facts that have come to light about Tesla. He was an electric engineer and a physicist of repute. He had over 300 patents credited to him but he became famous for developing the alternate current technology, which has a wide variety of uses. He was known for his terrific sense of humor. The museum in Wardenclyffe was funded by a cartoon showing the respect people had for his humor. Tesla, in the initial years, worked for Thomas Edison designing direct current generators. He moved away to pursue his own research. Though people described them as rivals, the fact of matter is that they were two sides of a coin. Tesla was at heart an environmentalist and was concerned about the way people were using the resources. He looked for ways to make renewable resources. In fact he created artificial lightning in his lab and found differences in electric potential on earth and high objects. As early as 1901, he had ideas about smart phone technology. He was a brilliant thinker but could not put his thoughts and ideas into practice. Tesla never bothered about monetary gains for his research and many a time did not have funds to work on his ideas. People term him a brilliant thinker and humanist. It is said that he had an earthquake mission in his lab and many occasions he would frighten the entire neighborhood when he used it. It is said that Mark Twain was one of the victims of this exercise.",

I think it's fair to say that these pattern books were the most important influence on the design of North American houses during the nineteenth century. This was because most people who wanted to build a house couldn't afford to hire an architect. Instead, they bought a pattern book, picked out a plan, and took it to the builder. The difference in cost was substantial. In 1870, for example, hiring an architect would've cost about a hundred dollars. At the same time, a pattern book written by an architect cost only five dollars. At that price, it's easy to see why pattern books were so popular. Some are back in print again today, and of course they cost a lot more than they did a hundred years ago. But they're an invaluable resource for historians, and also for people who restore old houses.

    "question": "A leader can define or clarify goals by issuing a memo or an executive order, an edict or a fatwa or a tweet, by passing a law, barking a command, or presenting an interesting idea in a meeting of colleagues. Leaders can mobilize people ’ s energies in ways that range from subtle, quiet persuasion to the coercive threat or the use of deadly force. Sometimes a charismatic leader such as Martin Luther King Jr. can define goals and mobilize energies through rhetoric and the power of example. We can think of leadership as a spectrum, in terms of both visibility and the power the leader wields. On one end of the spectrum, we have the most visible: authoritative leaders like the president of the United States or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, or a dictator such as Hitler or Qaddafi. At the opposite end of the spectrum is casual, low-key leadership found in countless situations every day around the world, leadership that can make a significant difference to the individuals whose lives are touched by it. Over the centuries, the first kind – the out-in - front, authoritative leadership – has generally been exhibited by men. Some men in positions of great authority, including Nelson Mandela, have chosen a strategy of “ leading from behind ”; more often, however, top leaders have been quite visible in their exercise of power.

I don't know if any of you saw it. I had an older child and two younger children, twins, strapped in a pushchair, and one of my children, three years old, shouted and I've never denied he shouted he shouted, ' Monster, monster! ' at this statue which looked just like a monster, had snakes for hair, a big beak for a nose. And, I thought, this is fantastic. I've got a three-year - old that's appreciating art. How good can it get? So, I bent down and I said, ' Yes, it looks just like a monster' And, at that moment, a room warden came over, a gallery assistant came over and said we were being too noisy, and threw us out to the wrong family. I was, at that time, a journalist with The Guardian newspaper, and two days later wrote a big piece in The Guardian about being thrown out of the Royal Academy. What was really interesting was, by the end of that day, we had had, at the paper, over 500 emails from other families saying, museums aren't working for us. Let's try and make it work. So, that's what we did. In the Guardian, we set up a campaign. We called it the Kids in Museums campaign, but it didn't really exist. It was just a few pages. We ran loads of stories on it; I began touring the country talking about how to make your museum family-friendly.",

    "question": "Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated, meaning they do not have a specific job or function. While skin cells protect your body, muscle cells contract and nerve cells send signals, stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions. Stem cells do have the potential to become all other kinds of cells in your body. Your body uses stem cells to replace worn-out cells when they die. For example, you completely replace the lining of your intestines every four days. Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines replace these cells as they wear out. Scientists hope that stem cells could be used to create a very special kind of personalized medicine, in which we could replace your own body parts with, well, your own body parts. Stem cell researchers are working hard to find ways in which to use stem cells to create new tissue to replace the parts of organs that are damaged by injury or disease. Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue is called regenerative medicine. For example, scientists currently use stem cells to treat patients with blood diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia is a form of cancer that affects your bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones where your blood cells are created. In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells that form your blood cells. Some leukemia patients can receive a stem cell transplant. These new stem cells will create the blood cells needed by the patient's body. There are actually multiple kinds of stem cells that scientists can use for medical treatments and research.

Australia's housing affordability now shapes the typical housing cycle or housing career as some people call it. Most Australians in the normal course of events are people who move through the housing cycle in a way that matches the stages of life that they're at. So, they move out of the family home in their late teens or early 20 s as they gain their independence from their families, then they rent save for a home they can afford as either a group, or maybe a couple. And maybe they can upgrade it when they have a family in their middle age, they are more than likely to have paid off their mortgage. And that means they have housing security in their old age. That's no longer the typical housing cycle for Australians, young people generally live at home for much longer than they once did. They generally rent for longer and they're more likely to be saddled with a mortgage not just into their middle age but more often than not into their retirement as well. In fact, in 2006, 65, 000 retiree households were still paying off the mortgage. Affordable rent is also an elusive right around Australia.

Here is the problem, there is actually a law of physics called the third law of thermodynamics, that says you cannot get to the absolutely zero, but we don' t really know it ’ s true, but we are pretty sure it is for the following reason: every time you think of some way of cooling something down a little bit, it means you try to get energy out of that thing and make the temperature lower. Well if you can get energy out, usually there is a way that the energy can go in as well. And that always means there is a competition between taking the energy out and putting the energy in. Now you can try to make it, so you are favoring getting energy out, but you can ’ t completely stop the energy from going in and that means you might be able to get colder and colder, but you won' t be able to get all the way to absolute zero. Could we go back to my power point, because I think that one of these slides will illustrate that point a little bit better. Yes, here, remember the logarithmic thermometer?

And so, he asked questions like, “ What would observers in this two dimensional universe see, say, if a three dimensional object like a sphere passed through the universe? ” And what this flatland universe would see would be a series of disks that grow in size and then decreased in size. In the same way that we can certainly think about a two dimensional world inside a three dimensional world, it could be that we observe three dimensions but really there are more. And if a hyper sphere say a four dimensional sphere passed through our universe, we would see a series of spheres that grew in size and then decreased in size.

However, when it comes to governments, particularly the White House, online interactions become more difficult as people tend to be coarser and ruder towards their governments, especially in comment areas. This leads to governments' blogs becoming chaotic and uncontrollable.######In conclusion, the speaker has emphasized that governments then have to impose strict administration on comment areas to maintain order. However, this can lead to citizens feeling that their government is manipulating what should be said and shown, which goes against the original intention of fostering open dialogue and engagement. Therefore, finding a balance between managing comments and preserving the original intention of blogging becomes a crucial challenge for governments.",

    "question": "After the recession era Europe confronted a change in economy structures in Europe. After industrial revolution around the 19 th century, the machinery was widely used in the manufacturing, so the production in factories increased. As a result, circulation of goods became faster, and this led to more accumulation of social wealth. Because of this, the population of middle class expanded and this resulted in the additional accumulation of wealth. This research that conducted by pioneering scientists examined the extent and patterns of structural changes that have occurred in European economies during the recent crisis using some stylized facts on changing output and employment structures at a detailed sectoral level. Focusing mainly on the new EU member states, we compare the performance of various European countries by looking at the differentiated impact of the recent crisis on structural shifts in their economy. We start with stylized facts related to output and employment structures at broader sectorial ( NACE- 2) level and attempt to find out whether there has been a structural convergence ( or divergence ) of the New EU Member States ( NMS ) compared to the more advanced ' old' EU countries ( OMS ) during the crisis. Finally, we provide also some policy conclusions related to the future role of the NMS in the economy of an integrated Europe, especially in view of post-crisis growth challenges. The financial crisis 2008-2011 adversely affected the manufacturing industry more than services- - particularly in terms of employment- - and accelerated structural change in favor of the services sector. The latter tendency was more pronounced in the NMS though even here country-specific differences were remarkable. The importance of industry in this group of countries remains strong. There has been no EU-wide uniform pattern of structural change; the formulation of industrial policy at the EU level- - even reaching the 20% target of industry's share in GDP- - is challenging and hardly attainable.",

Globalization had been widely believed to benefit people globally, including Latin American countries. But people are disappointed about the actual economic growth in that continent. Over the 20 years before globalization, the economy in Latin America developed by eighty percent. People thought taking part in globalization would achieve a higher economic growth rate. But in fact, the growth rate has dropped to ten percent after economic reforms related with globalization happened in Latin America. Accordingly, the poverty rate has increased, and the criterion of ' poverty' is ' earning no more than two dollars per day'. Thus, Latin America's economy has become unsustainable.

Soot is one of these little things. Soot also known as black carbon is released when you burn dung, coal, diesel fuel and wood. From Los Angeles to Mumbai, soot causes respiratory illnesses like lung cancer and asthma and contributes to one point six million premature deaths every year. Mostly among the poor. And it gets worse. Atmospheric currents carry soot thousands of miles from where it is produced, to the Himalayas and the Arctic. Black carbon being black, absorbs sunlight, so even a little soot on snow makes it melt faster. And when snow melts global sea levels rise, threatening our freshwater indigenous communities and polar bears who hunt on the Arctic ice. Climate Change has been a big thing for a while and carbon dioxide has been its main cause. Scientists estimate that soot causes twenty five percent of human-caused global warming. It ’ s the second leading cause of Arctic warming after carbon dioxide. Let ’ s not underestimate the impact of this tiny particle. But there ’ s good news, reducing black carbon may be the fastest way to slow global warming. Buy time for the Arctic. Yes even more so than changing a light bulb. Since black carbon only stays in the atmosphere for a couple of weeks, reducing it will produce results immediately. Of course, reducing soot alone won ’ t solve global warming, but solving our soot problem now will help buy time for the Arctic and allow us to deal with the bigger problem of carbon dioxide. We have the cleaner industries, cook stoves, and diesel now we have to use them. In developed nations, we ’ ve significantly reduced our black carbon, but we still have much more to do. We need to tighten our standards at home and invest in cleaner technologies in developing nations. In a world going on seven billion people, you might feel rather little yourself.

Asia's importance to Australia's economy is growing by the day. It is one of the most important factors to consider. When assessing the International conditions for national prosperity Asian demand for our exports has helped Australia manage the global financial crisis better than most other developed economies. In fact, probably better than all other developed economies. An investment from Asia has added to the productive capacity of the economy and to overall productivity in 2013. Seven of our top ten export markets were in Asia and represented 65 percent of our total exports. Asian markets and Australia's geographic proximity are critical not just for our trade ties and our capacity to access important global supply chains, but also to the level of foreign investment in Australia. FDI has grown markedly in Australia over the past decade. In fact it has more than doubled from about two hundred ninety two billion dollars to 630 billion dollars in 2013.",

    "question": "To someone first encountering the works of William Shakespeare. The language may seem strange, but there is a secret to appreciating it. Although he was famous for his plays, Shakespeare was first and foremost a poet. One of the most important things in Shakespeare's language is his use of stress. Not that kind of stress, but the way we emphasize certain syllables in words more than others. We're so used to doing this that we may not notice it at first. But if you say the word slowly, you can easily identify them. Poets are very aware of these stresses, having long experimented with the number and order of stressed and unstressed syllables and combined them in different ways to create rhythm in their poems. Like songwriters, poets often express their ideas through a recognizable repetition of these rhythms or poetic meter. Shakespeare's favorite meter in particular was iambic pentameter, where each line of force is made up of five two syllable items for a total of ten syllables. And it's used for many of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets. Why did Shakespeare choose iambic pentameter for these moments? It's been said that iambic pentameter was easy for his actors to memorize and for the audience to understand because it's naturally suited to the English language. But there might be another reason. Shakespeare's most poetic lines don't just talk about matters of the heart. They follow its rhythm.",

    "question": "Thermodynamics is simply defined as the branch of physics that deals with the conversion of different forms of energy, and the relations between heat and various energy forms such as mechanical, electrical or chemical energy. Kinetics deals with the actions of forces that cause various motions ( also known as dynamics ) and it is concerned with the rate of reactions. Temperature is the average kinetic energy within a given object. Thermal energy is defined as the total of all kinetic energies within a given system. It is important to remember that heat is caused by flow of thermal energy due to differences in temperature ( heat flows from object at higher temperature to object at lower temperature ), transferred through conduction / convection / radiation. Additionally thermal energy always flows from warmer areas to cooler areas. Energy occurs in many forms, including chemical energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic radiation, gravitational energy, electric energy, elastic energy, nuclear energy, and rest energy. These can be categorized in two main classes: potential energy and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object. Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy. Kinetic energy may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy. For example, a cyclist uses chemical energy provided by food to accelerate a bicycle to a chosen speed. On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air resistance and friction.

    "question": "A non-governmental organization ( NGO ) is an organization that is neither a part of a government nor a conventional for – profit business. Usually set up by ordinary citizens, NGOs may be funded by governments, foundations, businesses, or private persons. Some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. The number of NGOs in the United States is estimated at 1.5 million. Russia has 277, 000 NGOs. India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009, just over one NGO per 600 Indians, and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India. NGOs are difficult to define, and the term ‘ NGO ’ is rarely used consistently. As a result, there are many different classifications in use. The most common focus is on “ orientation ” and “ level of operation ”. An NGO ’ s orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO ’ s level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.

    "question": "Straight salary sales compensation plans aren't very common, but they do have a place in some organizations. With this type of structure, you'd pay your sales people a straight albeit competitive salary like all of your other employees, and nothing else. No bonuses, no commissions, and few, if any, sales incentives. This type of compensation plan is most often used when the industry you operate within prohibits direct sales, when sales people work as part of small groups or teams and all contributions are equal, when your sales team is relatively small, or when your sales people are expected to spend much of their time on other responsibilities other than selling. However, these plans don't tend to offer motivation to sales people, as there are no incentives for them to work harder. Salary plus commission sales compensation plans are possibly the most common plans used today. They're structured in a way that sales people receive a lower base salary along with commission pay that makes up the majority of the total compensation. Organizations use salary plus commission sales compensation plans when there are opportunities to support all sales people on this structure and when there are proper metrics in place for tracking sales to ensure that the splits are fair and accurate. This type of plan is often the better choice as opposed to straight salary because it offers motivation to increase productivity and to achieve goals. It also offers more stability. Sales people will still get some types of pay even if they're in training, when sales are low during certain months, or if market conditions get volatile. However, it can be more complex to administer. Commission only sales compensation plans are exactly what they sound like you pay your sales people for the sales they bring in and nothing else. There is no guarantee of income. These types of plans are easier to administer than salary plus commission and provide better value for your money paid as they are based solely on sales achieved. They also tend to attract fewer candidates, but do attract the most top-performing and hardest working sales professionals who know they can make a good income because they know how to sell. On the other hand, though, they can create aggression within your sales team and low income security, which can lead to a high turnover rate, and sales rep burnout from stress.",

    "question": "The amount of money drug companies spend on TV ads has doubled in recent years. Studies show they work: Consumers go to their doctor with a suggestion for a certain prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message the ads promote. You ’ re most likely to see drug ads during prime time, especially around the news. Researchers analysed ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpes, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis and allergies. The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. Researchers found that the information was technically accurate, but the tone was misleading. ” Typically, what we would see with these ads is that before taking a particular prescription drug, the character ’ s life is out of control and the loss of control extended beyond the impact of their health condition says UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch, who headed the study. For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days. Insomniacs were utterly out of 23 synch on the job. Depressed patients were friendless and boring at parties. ” When the character is then shown taking the drug, he then magically regains complete control of his life. ” Frosch notes. None of the ads mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition. That ’ s not surprising, given that the ads are just another form of mass marketing. But prescription medicines are not soap. Sample answer ： The lecture was about advertising. He mentioned that the advertisement on medicine prescription has doubled, compared to its prime time. People buy drugs depending on what they saw on the ads. Despite medicine ads may be technically accurate, they are misleading in tones. Depression patients, for example, may feel better after taking the medicine. However, it does not mean there is a change in their life style. Therefore, buying the prescription medicine is not like buying a soap, it takes a sober mind and careful decision and understanding of what we really need to improve.",

But rising temperatures aren't the only factor. Urban light pollution is also quickening the coming of spring. \" So temperature and light are really contributing to a double whammy of making everything earlier. \" Richard ffrench-Constant, an entomologist at the University of Exeter. He and his colleagues compiled 13 years of data from citizen scientists in the U. K. , who tracked the first bud burst of four common trees. Turns out, light pollution — from streetlights in cities, and along roads — pushed bud burst a full week earlier. Way beyond what rising temperatures could achieve. This disruptive timing can ripple through the ecosystem. \" The caterpillars that feed on trees are trying to match the hatching of their eggs to the timing of bud burst. Because the caterpillars want to feed on the juiciest and least chemically protected leaves. And it's not just the caterpillars, of course, that are important. But the knock-on effect is on nesting birds, which are also trying to hatch their chicks at the same time that there's the maximum number of caterpillars. \" So earlier buds could ultimately affect the survival of birds, and beyond. The findings are in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The world's becoming increasingly urbanized, and light pollution is growing — which ffrench-Constant says could trick trees into budding earlier and earlier. But smarter lighting — like LEDs that dial down certain wavelengths — could help. \" Perhaps the exciting thing is, if we understand more about how light affects this bud burst, we might be able to devise smarter sort of street lighting that has less red components, and therefore less early bud burst. \" Thus keeping springtime an actual springtime phenomenon.",

This is attributed to a combination of rising temperatures and urban light pollution. The speaker emphasizes that light pollution, from streetlights and roads, is causing bud burst in trees to occur a full week earlier, surpassing the effects of rising temperatures alone.######In conclusion, the earlier bud burst caused by light pollution can disrupt the ecosystem. Caterpillars, which rely on the timing of bud burst for their eggs to hatch, may struggle to find the most suitable leaves to feed on. This can have a ripple effect on nesting birds, as they try to coincide the hatching of their chicks with the presence of caterpillars. The survival of birds and other species could be impacted by earlier buds. The speaker suggests that smarter lighting solutions, such as LEDs with reduced red components, could potentially mitigate the early bud burst caused by light pollution and help preserve the natural timing of spring.",

    "question": "Flipping a coin may not be the fairest way to settle disputes. About a decade ago, statistician Persi Diaconis started to wonder if the outcome of a coin flip really is just a matter of chance. He had Harvard University engineers build him a mechanical coin flipper. Diaconis, now at Stanford University, found that if a coin is launched exactly the same way, it lands exactly the same way. The randomness in a coin toss, it appears, is introduced by sloppy humans. Each human-generated flip has a different height and speed, and is caught at a different angle, giving different outcomes. But using high speed cameras and equations, Diaconis and colleagues have now found that even though humans are largely unpredictable coin flippers, there's still a bias built in, if a coin starts out heads, it ends up heads when caught more often than it does tails.

The next thing I want you to remember is how to ride a bike. The reason I asked you to recall both of these memories is that they belong to two different designated realms of memory. Memory is a fluid and dynamic system that is exceedingly complicated. To this end, psychologists have attempted to divide memory up to make it easier to study. There are two main categories. Explicit memory is a memory that can be intentionally and consciously recalled. This is your memory of riding a bike and falling over the handlebars, and skinning your knee. The other is implicit memory which is an exponential functional form of memory that cannot be consciously recalled. This is your memory of how to ride a bike or how to balance. These are often not tied to a visual memory, but a more like muscle memory. The examples of implicit memory include using language naturally, driving and reading, and answering multiple questions in the test, etc. , will be natural. Let's look at explicit and implicit memory in a little more detail, and see how age influences these. It is an experimental or functional form of memory. Explicit memory consists of a great deal of highly personal memories related to time, space and people. It is totally different from implicit memory.

    "question": "In 1943, what became known as the Green Revolution began when Mexico, unable to feed its growing population, shouted for help. Within a few years, the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations founded the International Rice Research Institute in Asia, and by 1962, a new strain of rice called IR 8 was feeding people all over the world. IR 8 was the first really big modified crop to make a real impact on world hunger. In 1962 the technology did not yet exist to directly manipulate the genes of plants, and so IR 8 was created by carefully crossing existing varieties: selecting the best from each generation, further modifying them, and finally finding the best. Here is the power of modified crops: IR 8, with no fertilizer, straight out of the box, produced five times the yield of traditional rice varieties. In optimal conditions with nitrogen, it produced ten times the yield of traditional varieties. By 1980, IR 36 resisted pests and grew fast enough to allow two crops a year instead of just one, doubling the yield. And by 1990, using more advanced genetic manipulation techniques, IR 72 was outperforming even IR 36. The Green Revolution saw worldwide crop yields explode from 1960 through 2000.",

Now for an ethical point of view, it ’ s hard to argue against a policy that will do so much to help people that are much poorer than ourselves. The famous Rand Study reckons that a typical immigrant who arrives in US ends up with $20, 000 a year, that ’ s rough. It ’ s not just the migrants themselves who gain, it ’ s the countries they come from. Already, the migrants working for poor countries working in rich countries send home around 200 billion dollars a year, through formal channels, and about twice as that through informal channels. And that compares to the neat a hundred million dollars that Western governments give in aid. These remittances are not wasted on weapons or siphoned off into Swiss bank accounts; they go straight into the pockets of local people. They pay for food, clean water, and medicines, they help kids in school, they help start up new business. Sample answer: Removing immigration control would double the world economy. This policy will do so much to help poor people. Immigrants ends up with 20000 a year from gain and countries they come from.

    "question": "Turner, not surprisingly, painted one of the earliest pictures of London's fog, in the 1835 painting the Thames above Waterloo Bridge. Turner is a trueborn Londoner, is advertising his familiarity with London's air problem by putting smoke, an atmospheric pollution at its center. And as you can see, in here, the bridge is the central elements, which is a theme that's later taken up by Monet. And it's partly obscured by the steam and smoke which rises from both sides of the river. Here, we see a shot-tower. I think you can just about to see, which was constructed in 1826. Do you know what shot-towers are? They produce shot for guns, ammunition. And they were very smoky, one of the more smoking industries. But it's barely visible, as you can see, as are the various industries on the Lambuth side of the river. There's, on this side, there's a steamship about to dock or preparing to leave. It's black smoke thrusting up to join the kind of swirling arc of smoke there. William Rodner sees this painting as a potent essay on the energy and complexity of modern polluted organism. Smoke, I think, here represents for a flourishing economy, which brings employment and food on tables but also the dirt and pollution associated with the fumes all seems to be tainted by sulfurous yellow.",

    "answer_ai": "The lecture is about J.M.W. Turner's 1835 painting \"The Thames above Waterloo Bridge\" and its depiction of London's fog and industrial pollution.######The speaker has highlighted the significant fact that Turner, being a trueborn Londoner, used this painting to showcase his familiarity with London's air problem by prominently featuring smoke as a central element. The bridge itself serves as a central theme, later taken up by Monet, but is partially obscured by the steam and smoke emanating from both sides of the river. The speaker also points out the presence of a shot-tower, a smoky industry that produced ammunition, barely visible in the painting. Moreover, various industries on the Lambuth side of the river are also scarcely discernible amidst the pollution. Furthermore, a steamship with its black smoke is depicted either docking or preparing to leave, symbolizing the energy and complexity of a modern polluted organism.######In conclusion, the speaker suggests that the painting serves as a potent essay on the dual nature of a flourishing economy; while it brings employment and sustenance to society, it also brings forth dirt and pollution, represented by the sulfurous yellow taint of the smoke.",

    "question": "If your recruiting efforts attract job applicants with too much experience — a near certainty in this weak labor market — you should consider a response that runs counter to most hiring managers' MO: Don't reject those applicants out of hand. Instead, take a closer look. New research shows that overqualified workers tend to perform better than other employees, and they don't quit any sooner. Furthermore, a simple managerial tactic — empowerment — can mitigate any dissatisfaction they may feel. The prejudice against too-good employees is pervasive. Companies tend to prefer an applicant who is a ' perfect fit' over someone who brings more intelligence, education, or experience than needed. On the surface, this bias makes sense: Studies have consistently shown that employees who consider themselves overqualified exhibit higher levels of discontent. For example, overqualification correlated well with job dissatisfaction in a 2008 study of 156 call-center reps by Israeli researchers Saul Fine and Baruch Nevo. And unlike discrimination based on age or gender, declining to hire overqualified workers is perfectly legal. But even before the economic downturn, a surplus of overqualified candidates was a global problem, particularly in developing economies, where rising education levels are giving workers more skills than are needed to supply the growing service sectors. If managers can get beyond the conventional wisdom, the growing pool of too-good applicants is a great opportunity. Berrin Erdogan and Talya N. Bauer of Portland State University in Oregon found that overqualified workers' feelings of dissatisfaction can be dissipated by giving them autonomy in decision making. At stores where employees didn't feel empowered, ' overeducated' workers expressed greater dissatisfaction than their colleagues did and were more likely to state an intention to quit. But that difference vanished where self-reported autonomy was high.",

    "question": "The first inhabitants in Australia were the ancestors of the present indigenous people. Whether these first migrations involved one or several successive waves and distinct peoples is still subject to academic debate, as is its timing. The minimum widely accepted time frame places presence of humans in Australia at 40000 to 43000 years Before Present, while the upper range supported by others is 60000 to 70000 years BP. In any event, this migration was achieved during the closing stages of the Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much lower than they are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass ( known as Sahul ), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait. The ancestral Australian Aboriginal peoples were thus long established and continued to develop, diversity and settle through much of the continent. As the sea levels again rose at the terminus of the most recent glacial period some 10000 years ago the Australian continent once more became a separated landmass. However, the newly formed 150 km wide Torres Strait with its chain of islands still provided the means for cultural contact and trade between New Guinea and the northern Cape York Penisula. During the 1970 s and 1980 s around 120000 southern Asian refugees migrated to Australia. During that twenty years, Australia first began to adopt a policy of what Minister of Immigration AI Grass by termed \" multiculturalism \". In 2004-5, Australia accepted 123000 new settles, 19 a 40% increase over the past 10 years. The largest number of immigrants (40000 in 200405) moved to Sydney.

    "question": "Our friends at the Highlands Museum and Discovery Center in Ashland, Kentucky, asked a very good question. Why is it dark in space? That question is not as simple as it may sound. You might think that space appears dark at night because that is when our side of Earth faces away from the Sun as our planet rotates on its axis every 24 hours. But what about all those other far away suns that appear as stars in the night sky? Our own Milky Way galaxy contains over 200 billion stars, and the entire universe probably contains over 100 billion galaxies. You might suppose that that many stars would light up the night like daytime! Until the 20 th century, astronomers didn't think it was even possible to count all the stars in the universe. They thought the universe went on forever. In other words, they thought the universe was infinite. Besides being very hard to imagine, the trouble with an infinite universe is that no matter where you look in the night sky, you should see a star. Stars should overlap each other in the sky like tree trunks in the middle of a very thick forest. But, if this were the case, the sky would be blazing with light. This problem greatly troubled these astronomers and became known as \" Olbers' Paradox. \" A paradox is a statement that seems to disagree with itself. To try to explain the paradox, some 19 th century scientists thought that dust clouds between the stars must be absorbing a lot of the starlight so it wouldn't shine through to us. But later scientists realized that the dust itself would absorb so much energy from the starlight that eventually it would glow as hot and bright as the stars themselves. Astronomers now realize that the universe is not infinite. A finite universe — that is, a universe of limited size — even one with trillions and trillions of stars, just wouldn't have enough stars to light up all of space. Although the idea of a finite universe explains why Earth's sky is dark at night, other causes work to make it even darker.",

However, astronomers have discovered that the universe is not infinite, and therefore, there are not enough stars to light up all of space.######In conclusion, the finite nature of the universe, combined with other factors, explains why space is dark. The concept of an infinite universe, which would result in stars overlapping each other and a sky blazing with light, was disproven by the paradox known as \"Olbers' Paradox.\" Additionally, the idea that dust clouds between the stars absorb starlight was deemed insufficient, as the dust itself would eventually glow as bright as the stars.

    "question": "Before we consider international environmental law and climate change we need to consider domestic legislation, as it is within the sovereign states that international law is put into practice. This reflects the environmentalists' maxim, ' think globally act locally'. United Kingdom legislative control over the impacts of mans' activity on the environment is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II the main concern was the production of smoke from the burning of ' sea coal. Almost all areas of trade and industry were subject to very detailed legislative controls at that time, although some were governed by ' self-regulation ' in the form of guilds, who regulated both supply and methods of production. However, the measures implemented were mostly ineffective because then, as now, the specifying of legal duties and standards without providing any appropriate enforcement merely indicated good intentions but were of little practical effect.

Local industrialists used the Adam Smith model to maximize their economic benefit, but this was to the detriment of the local environment with the operation of ' Gresham's Law' that is, the bad drives out the good.

Sovereign states play a pivotal role in implementing international law, and the concept of \"think globally, act locally\" is emphasized by environmentalists.######In the United Kingdom, legislative control over the impacts of human activities on the environment has a long history. Even during the reign of Charles II, concerns were raised about the production of smoke from burning sea coal. Detailed legislative controls were implemented in various trade and industry sectors, but self-regulation through guilds also played a role in governing supply and production methods.######However, the effectiveness of these measures was limited. Merely specifying legal duties and standards without appropriate enforcement indicated good intentions but had little practical effect. The advent of the Industrial Revolution and the urbanization of society brought about new challenges to the environment. Local industrialists pursued economic benefits using the Adam Smith model, often at the expense of the local environment. This led to the operation of \"Gresham's Law,\" where the bad practices prevailed over the good ones.######Industrialists who prioritized the health of their employees and the local environment faced higher costs compared to their competitors. As a result, comprehensive statutory controls were increasingly necessary to regulate the discharge of pollutants into different receiving media.######In conclusion, the lecture highlights the importance of domestic legislation in the United Kingdom in addressing the environmental impacts of human activities. Recognizing the role of sovereign states in implementing international environmental law is essential, and the principles of thinking globally and acting locally are emphasized. Over time, more comprehensive statutory controls have been required to address pollution issues arising from industrialization and urbanization.",

    "question": "The Right Honorable Sir Winston Leonard Spencer- - Churchill, KG, OM, CH, FRS, PC ( November 30, 1874 – January 24, 1965) was a British statesman, best known as prime minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War. At various times a soldier, journalist, author, and politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the most important leaders in British and world history. Considered reactionary on some issues, such as granting independence to Britain's colonies and at times regarded as a self- - promoter who changed political parties to further his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Some of his peacetime decisions, such as restoring the Gold Standard in 1924, were disastrous as was his World War I decision to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler's Nazi Germany in the free world, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people during their darkest hour. Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny. Indeed, he believed that God had placed him on earth to carry out heroic deeds for the protection of Christian civilization and human progress. A providential under standing of history would concur with Churchill's self- - understanding. Considered old- - fashioned, even reactionary by some people today, he was actually a visionary whose dream was of a united world, beginning with a union of the English- - speaking peoples, then embracing all cultures. In his youth, he cut a dashing figure as a cavalry officer as seen in the 1972 film Young Winston ( directed by Richard Attenborough ), but the images of him that are the most widely remembered are as a rather overweight, determined, even pugnacious looking senior statesman as he is depicted to the right.",

    "question": "When Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time. Curriculum reforms intended to improve equity often fail to do so because they increase breadth or differentiation in offerings in a way that increases differences in quality. Further, these differences in quality often reflect differences in students' social backgrounds because the ' new' offerings are typically taken up by relatively disadvantaged students who are not served well them. Evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point. The need to Improve the quality of education is well accepted across OECD and other countries as they seek to strengthen their human capital to underpin their modern, knowledge economies. Improved equity is also important for this purpose, since the demand for high — level skills is widespread and the opportunities for the low — skilled are diminishing. Improved equity in education is also important for social cohesion. There are countries in which the education system seems primarily to reproduce existing social arrangements, conferring privilege where it already exists and denying it where it does not. Even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.",

    "question": "Haussmann's renovation of Paris was a vast public works program commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugene Haussmann, between 1853 and 1870. It included the demolition of crowded and unhealthy medieval neighborhoods, the building of wide avenues, parks and squares, the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Paris, and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870; but work on his projects continued until 1927. The street plan and distinctive appearance of the center of Paris today is largely the result of Haussmann's renovation. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the center of Paris was overcrowded, dark, dangerous, and unhealthy. In 1845 the French social reformer Victor Considerant wrote \" Paris is an immense workshop of putrefaction, where misery, pestilence and sickness work in concert, where sunlight and air rarely penetrate. Paris is a terrible place where plants shrivel and perish, and where, of seven small infants, four die during the course of the year. \" The street plan on the Tie de la Cite and in the neighborhood called the \" quartier des Arcis \", between the Louvre and the \" Hotel de Ville \" ( City Hall ), had changed little since the Middle Ages. The population density in these neighborhoods was extremely high, compared with the rest of Paris ； in the neighborhood of the Champs — EIysees, there was one resident for every 186 square meters ； in the neighborhoods of Arc is and Saint- Avoye, in the present Third Arrondissement, there was one inhabitant for every three square meters. In 1840, a doctor described one building in the tie de la Cite where a single room five meters squares on the fourth floor was occupied by twenty-three people, both adults and children. In these conditions, disease spread very quickly. Cholera epidemics ravaged the city in 1832 and 1848. In the epidemic of 1848, five percent of the inhabitants of these two neighborhoods died. Traffic circulation was another major problem. The widest streets in these two neighborhoods were only five meters wide ； the narrowest were only one or two meters wide. Wagons, carriages and carts could barely move through the streets. The center of the city was also a cradle of discontent and revolution ； between 1830 and 1848, seven armed uprisings and revolts had broken out in the centre of Paris, particularly along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, around the Hotel de Vi Ile, and around Montagne Sainte Genevive on the left bank. The residents of these neighborhoods had taken up paving stones and blocked the narrow streets with barricades, and had to be dislodged by the army.",

There are all kinds of reasons why languages die; one is physical reason when people are affected by famine, disease and earthquake. Another is genocide, when some countries deliberately stamp out a small language. The main reason is globalization. That is, some huge languages in the world, like English, Arabic, Spanish and French, and these are like steam rollers crushing the smaller languages they find in their path.

Additionally, financial resources are needed to train teachers, create educational materials, and support other necessary initiatives. Without adequate funding, endangered languages cannot have a positive future.",

    "question": "Now let's focus on comics in the 1950' s. Early in the decade sales were down, so publishers started looking for some new angle to get their readers interested again. They found what they were looking for with horror comics, stories about ghosts and demons that were often graphically violent. Before long, most of the major publishers were printing horror comics, but it all came to an end a few years later. You see, there was a psychologist named Frederic Wertham who claimed that comic books, the horror books in particular, were a bad influence on children and turned them into juvenile delinquents. Wertham even wrote a book called Seduction of the Innocent that showed specific scenes from comics that he thought were a particularly bad influence on kids. Wertham wasn't the only one down on comics. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency also released a report very critical of comics. The result of all this fuss was the creation of the Comics Code Authority in 1995. This is a self-censoring body created by the publishers. Essentially, for a comic book to be approved by the code, it had to be free of the blood and gore that was usually depicted in most horror comics, and evil could never triumph over good. Children had to be shown that crime did not pay. Well, if comic sales were bad in 1950, things got even worse in 1955. Many small publishers actually went out of business. But the industry rebounded by introducing a new lineup of superheroes, characters like Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. Now, I've brought with me today some comic books from this era to pass around. They're from my own personal collection, so please be extra careful when handling them.",

    "question": "Well, if there are no more questions, I would like to continue our discussion of human evolution by looking at Homo erectus, the earliest of our ancestors who stood upright. Homo erectus lived about one and a half million years ago and was given that name because, at the time the first fossil was discovered, it represented the first primate to stand upright. There is evidence now that Homo erectus had sharper mental skills than their predecessors. They constructed the first standardized tool for hunting and butchering. They created an extraordinary stone implement, a large teardrop-shaped hand ax whose design and symmetry reveal a keen sense of aesthetics. This detailing, along with the ax's utilitarian value, strongly suggests that Homo erectus had the ability to conceive of and execute a design to specification. In addition, Homo erectus was the first hominid to use fire. This discovery enticed them to cook meat, which they could flavor and keep from spilling by flame, and which paleontologists now believe may have given them a new disease. Some fossil bones of Homo erectus are grossly deformed, and paleontologists have noted that this condition is similar to that found in people today who have been exposed to chronic overdoses of vitamin A. Apparently Homo erectus first got this disease by eating large amounts of animal liver.",

    "question": "Now, you've been reading articles about the tremendous damage done to life and property by earthquakes. That's why seismologists have been working so hard to develop methods of earthquake prediction. We can now predict earthquakes fairly well, but the predictions only locate potential areas of danger. They don't predict the specific time and location at which an earthquake is likely to occur. Today I want to introduce to you three prediction models that have been developed. The first prediction model looks along earthquake faults, those cracks in the Earth's crust, to find what are known as seismic gaps. Seismic gaps are places where the fault has shown little or no seismic activity for a long time. This theory postulates that such places are due for a major shock. The second model relies on phenomena, like ground tilt. Using long cylindrical tubes containing water, observers noted that ground tilt tended to occur before major earthquakes. That led them to correctly predict the big Haicheng quake of 1975, the first successful earthquake prediction scientists have ever made. A million people were evacuated from that Chinese city before the earthquake struck. Unfortunately, this method hasn't worked consistently, so we can't say it's been perfected. The third model is based on the theory that major earthquakes closely follow a series of minor ones. Starting with the measurements and timing of the smaller quakes, a complex formula calculates the \" times of increased probability \" of a much larger quake. Right now, this method, like the first method, cannot predict specific times and places, but that may change as it is further developed. For the moment, none of these models can predict with reasonable levels of confidence.",

    "question": "We're going to start today talking about congressional aides, that is, the people who work for our congressional representatives, both in Washington and in the representatives' local districts. It used to be that members of Congress had a relatively small staff of people working for them, and the role of these people wasn't of primary importance. But now there are thousands of congressional aides, and they've profoundly affected the way the whole government works. Congressional aides work in two different locations: one, in the congressional representatives' local offices, the districts from which they were elected, and two, in Washington. Staff in the local offices help members of Congress stay in touch with citizens in their districts. These citizens can bring problems in in person, or by mail or phone. This personal connection between the aides and the local people can be helpful when the next election comes around. People remember the help they get from the office of their local congressional representative. But as you know, members of Congress have to spend most of their time in Washington taking care of their legislative duties. Over six thousand new laws are introduced in Congress each session. Without help, representatives would have trouble keeping up with the proposed laws that directly affect their districts. So that's why the congressional aides play a major role in Washington. They keep their bosses informed about pending legislation, organize hearings, and just keep their local congressional representatives up-to - date and informed on what's going on in other parts of Congress. Now another thing congressional aides do is to help develop ideas for laws that their bosses can eventually propose to Congress. This can be called the staff's entrepreneurial function, a bit like a business executive trying to find out what products are most popular. Congressional aides promote or encourage laws they think will be popular with the public. You've also got other employees that work for the whole Congress, not just for individual members.

    "question": "Human populations near the equator have evolved dark skin over many generations because of exposure to the fierce rays of the Sun. A similar phenomenon has also occurred in other parts of the animal kingdom. The African grass mouse is a good example. Most mice are nocturnal, but the African grass mouse is active during daylight hours. This means that it spends its days searching for food in the semidry bush and scrub habitats of eastern and southern Africa. Its fur is striped, like a chipmunk's, which helps it blend in with its environment. Because it spends a lot of time in the intense tropical sun, the grass mouse has also evolved two separate safeguards against the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. First, like the populations of humans in this region of the world, the skin of the grass mouse contains lots of melanin, or dark pigment. Second, and quite unusual, this mouse has a layer of melanin-pigmented tissue between its skull and skin. This unique \" cap \" provides an extra measure of protection for the grass mouse and three other types of African mouse-like rodents that are active during the day. The only other species scientists have identified with the same sort of skull adaptation is the white tent-making bat of the Central American tropics.

    "question": "So, why did what is now called \" modern dance \" begin in the United States? To begin to answer this question, I'll need to backtrack a little bit and talk about classical ballet. By the late 1800' s, ballet had lost a lot of its popularity. Most of the ballet dancers who performed in the United States were brought over from Europe. They performed using the rigid techniques that had been passed down through the centuries. Audiences and dancers in the United States were eager for their own, \" contemporary \" dance form. And, so, around 1900, dancers created one. So, how was this \" modern \" dance so different from classical ballet? Well, most notably, it wasn't carefully choreographed. Instead, the dance depended on the improvisation and free, personal expression of the dancers. Music and scenery were of little importance to the \" modern \" dance, and lightness of movement wasn't important either. In fact, modern dancers made no attempt at all to conceal the effort involved in a dance step. But even if improvisation appealed to audiences, many dance critics were less than enthusiastic about the performances. They questioned the artistic integrity of dancers who were not professionally trained and the artistic value of works that had no formal structure. Loie Fuller, after performing Fire Dance, was described as doing little more than turning \" round and round like an eggbeater. \" Yet, the free, personal expression of the pioneer dancers is the basis of the \" controlled freedom \" of modern dance today.",

When you entered as first-year students this year, the school assigned you to a dorm and a roommate, but next year as returning students you'll choose both your roommate and your dorm. But whether or not you actually get to live in your first choice depends on what number you or your roommate draws in the lottery system. The system gives priority to the students who have been here longest. Fourth-year students get the first block of numbers, third-years get the second block, and second-years — like you'll be — get the third. The lower the number you draw, the sooner you choose. Number one gets the first choice, number two gets the second choice, and so on. You can use either your own or your intended roommate's number to make your room choice. If your roommate for next year has been at the school longer than you have, they'll be in a better block of numbers and so will have a better number than any second-year student. But most of you will probably be rooming with other second-year students and so neither of you may have a great number. You may not get into your first or even second choice. Of course, if you've made plans to live off campus, you don't need to enter the lottery at all.

They gathered around a campfire, and after hours of discussion, they decided that they should not claim this land for themselves. They felt it should be accessible to everyone. So they began a campaign to preserve this land for everyone's enjoyment. Two years later, in the late nineteenth century, an act of Congress signed by President Ulysses S.

There are things parents, teachers, and the children themselves can do to overcome this tendency and even to prevent it. One researcher found that if parents gently push their shy children to try new things, they can help these children become less afraid and less inhibited. Another way to help shy children is to train them in social skills. For example, there are special training groups where children are taught things like looking at other children while talking to them, talking about other people's interests, and even smiling.

    "question": "Current studies show that what goes on labels is an important consideration for manufacturers, since more than seventy percent of shoppers read food labels when considering whether to buy a product. A recent controversy as to whether labels on prepared foods should educate or merely inform the consumer is over, and a consumer group got its way. The group had maintained that product labels should do more than simply list how many grams of nutrients a food contains. Their contention was that labels should also list the percentage of a day's total nutrients that the product will supply to the consumer, because this information is essential in planning a healthy diet. A government agency disagreed strongly, favoring a label that merely informs the consumer, in other words, a label that only lists the contents of the products. The agency maintained that consumers could decide for themselves if the food is nutritious and is meeting their daily needs. The consumer group, in supporting its case, had cited a survey in which shoppers were shown a food label, and were then asked if they would need more or less of a certain nutrient after eating a serving of this product. The shoppers weren't able to answer the questions easily when they were not given a specific percentage. This study, and others helped get the new regulation passed, and now food products must have the more detailed labels.",

    "question": "It seems like only yesterday that I was sitting where you are, just finishing my first year of medical school and wondering if I'd ever get a chance to use all my new knowledge on a real live patient! Well, I have good news for you! You don't have to wait until your third or fourth year of medical school to get some hands-on experience! The dean has invited me here to tell you about the university's rural opportunity program. If you enroll in this program, you can have the opportunity this summer, after your first year of medical school, to spend from four to six weeks observing and assisting a real physician like me in a small rural community. You won't have to compete with other students for time and attention, and you can see what life as a country doctor is really like. The program was designed to encourage medical students like yourselves to consider careers in rural communities that are still understaffed. It seems that medical students are afraid to go into rural family practice for two reasons. First, they don't know much about it. And second, specialists in the cities usually make more money. But, on the up-side, in rural practice, doctors can really get to know their patients and be respected members of the community. I participated in the program when it first started and spent six weeks in a small rural town. Let me tell you, it was really great! I got to work with real patients. I watched the birth of a child, assisted an accident victim, and had lots of really practical hands-on experience — all in one summer. And to my surprise, I found that country life has a lot to offer that city life doesn't — no pollution or traffic jams, for instance! My experience made me want to work where I'm needed and appreciated. I don't miss the city at all!",

    "question": "Word comes from California of a new weapon in the war on household pests. Two scientists working for a firm in Anaheim, California, have developed a method to eliminate insects without using dangerous chemicals. The new poison? Hot air. The basic idea is that insects cannot adjust to temperatures much above normal. In laboratory experiments, cockroaches and termites can't survive much more than a quarter of an hour at 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 50 degrees centigrade. The new method involves covering a house with a huge tent and filling it with air heated to around 65 degrees centigrade. Hot air is forced in with fans, and the tent keeps the heat inside the house. Since termites try to escape by hiding in wooden beams, the heat treatment must be continued for a full six hours. But when it's all over, and the insects are dead, there are no toxic residues to endanger humans or pets, and no funny smells. Scientists claim that there is no danger of fire, either, since very few household materials will burn at 65 degrees centigrade. In fact, wood is prepared for construction use by drying it in ovens at 80 degree centigrade, which is substantially hotter than the air used in this procedure.",

    "question": "Today we're going to practice evaluating the main tool used when addressing groups — the voice. There are three main elements that combine to create either a positive or negative experience for listeners. They can result in a voice that is pleasing to listen to and can be used effectively. Or they can create a voice that doesn't hold attention, or even worse, causes an adverse reaction. The three elements are volume, pitch, and pace. When evaluating volume, keep in mind that a good speaker will adjust to the size of both the room and the audience. Of course, with an amplifying device like a microphone, the speaker can use a natural tone. But speakers should not be dependent on microphones; a good speaker can speak loudly without shouting. The second element, pitch, is related to the highness or lowness of the sounds. High pitches are, for most people, more difficult to listen to, so in general speakers should use the lower registers of their voice. During a presentation, it's important to vary pitch to some extent in order to maintain interest. The third element, pace, that is how fast or slow words and sounds are articulated, should also be varied. A slower pace can be used to emphasize important points. Note that the time spent not speaking can be meaningful, too. Pauses ought to be used to signal transitions or create anticipation. Because a pause gives the listeners time to think about what was just said or even to predict what might come next, it can be very effective when moving from one topic to another. What I'd like you to do now is watch and listen to a videotape and use the forms I gave you to rate the speaking voices you hear.

    "question": "Welcome to the Four Winds Historical Farm, where traditions of the past are preserved for visitors like you. Today, our master thatchers will begin giving this barn behind me a sturdy thatched roof, able to withstand heavy winds and last up to a hundred years. How do they do it? Well, in a nutshell, thatching involves covering the beams or rafters, the wooden skeleton of a roof with reeds or straw. Our thatchers here have harvested their own natural materials for the job, the bundles of water reeds you see lying over there beside the barn. Thatching is certainly uncommon in the Untied States today. I guess that's why so many of you have come to see this demonstration. But it wasn't always that way. In the seventeenth century, the colonists here thatched their roofs with reeds and straw, just as they had done in England. After a while, though, they began to replace the thatch with wooden shingles because wood was so plentiful. And eventually, other roofing materials like stone, slate, and clay tiles came into use. It's a real shame that most people today don't realize how strong and long lasting a thatched roof is. In Ireland, where thatching is still practiced, the roofs can survive winds of up to one hundred ten miles per hour. That's because straw and reeds are so flexible. They bend but don't break in the wind like other materials can. Another advantage is that the roofs keep the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter. And then, of course, there's the roofs' longevity — the average is sixty years, but they can last up to a hundred. With all these reasons to start thatching roofs again, wouldn't it be wonderful to see this disappearing craft return to popularity?",

    "question": "Did you ever wonder why it is that most people are \" programmed \" to sleep at night instead of during the day? If there's something about the cycle of light and dark that's telling us when to sleep, then shouldn't the sleep cycle of a blind person be different? As it turns out, many blind people — people with no visual perception of light at all — do have the same sleep cycle as sighted people. So now you're wondering, \" How can this happen? \" The answer is: hormones, one hormone in particular. It's called melatonin. In sighted people, the level of melatonin goes up at night, or when it's dark, and goes down in the day, or when it's light. It's believed that it's the presence of this hormone in the blood that gives us the urge to sleep. If an increase in melatonin level \" programs \" sighted people to sleep at night, then what about blind people? A researcher, named Dr. Charles Czeisler, tells about an interesting experiment. He tried shining a bright light into the eyes of some blind people. When he did this, he noticed that the level of the melatonin in the blood of these subjects went down just as it would do for sighted people. Somehow, the eyes of these subjects, even though they were damaged and had no visual perception of light, could tell their brain when there was more or less light. Now, this doesn't work for all blind people; in fact, most of Czeisler's subjects had no hormonal response to light at all.

    "question": "If you liked the colorful animals we just saw, you're going to love these next animals: frogs. You might not normally think of frogs as being colorful, but these frogs definitely are. They are the dart-poison frogs of Central and South America. Look at their striking colors, often yellow with black stripes or deep blue with black spots. Beyond being nice to look at, these markings have a purpose. They warn predators that these frogs are poisonous. When threatened, these frogs secrete a substance through their skin that would easily kill whatever animal might try to eat them. Their bright colors communicate this, and so most animals tend not to hunt them. Now, speaking of hunting, for centuries these frogs were sought after by hunters. As you might think, the hunters didn't want to eat the frogs, but rather, they captured them for their poison. They would add the poison to the tips of their hunting arrows. Of course, nowadays most hunters use guns. These days, dart-poison frogs are of less interest to hunters than to medical researchers. Researchers believe that they can make new heart medicine from the poison, because it acts as a stimulant on the body's nervous system. Researchers think they could use it to stimulate a weak heart. There is, however, a problem with doing research on these frogs. Those that are caught in the wild will produce their poison until they die.

    "question": "Okay, as you look at this next exhibit, you'll notice something quite common — an ordinary bar of soap. Now, soap has been around a long time. In fact, the ancient Phoenicians produced soap as a substance for washing the body way back in 600 B. C. They made it by blending goat's fat with wood ash. The Phoenicians, as you may know, regularly traded along the Mediterranean, and they were the ones who introduced soap to the Greeks and Romans. Now, soap was not something welcomed by all countries. In fact, during the superstitious Middle Ages, many people were afraid to bathe their whole body too frequently. They thought it could be dangerous for their health — that it could even kill them. And even after the production of soap became common in some European countries in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, even then some people in the heart of Europe refused to use it. You'll find it interesting that when a duchess was given a box of soap as a present in 1549, she was so insulted that she had the gift-giver thrown off her estate! But by the nineteenth century the attitude toward soap had changed drastically. In some regions of Europe the tax on soap was so high that people secretly made their own.

I decided that the best way to assess the need for expanded hours was to talk to the people who were still in the student center at closing time. First, over the course of the two weeks, I interviewed more than fifty students as they left the student center at its regular closing time of twelve midnight. About eighty percent of them said they would prefer that the center stay open later. Of the three main uses of the center — eating in the snack bar, recreation in the game room or watching TV, and studying by far the most popular late night activity is — and this may surprise you — studying. Almost all of the people I talked to said that their main reason for being in the center after ten p. m. was to study in groups or to find a quiet place to study because their dorm was too noisy. Of course, many of these people used the snack bar or TV room for breaks. My recommendation is that we ask the administration to keep the center open after midnight for studying.

    "question": "These days we take for granted the wide variety of music available on the radio. But, this wasn't always the case. In the early days of radio, stations were capable of broadcasting only a narrow range of sounds, which was all right for the human voice but music didn't sound very good. There was also a great deal of crackling and other static noises that further interfered with the quality of the sound. A man named Edwin Armstrong, who was a music lover, set out to change this. He invented FM radio, a technology that allowed stations to send a broad range of frequencies that greatly improved the quality of the music. Now, you'd think that this would have made him a millionaire; it didn't. Radio stations at that time had invested enormous amounts of money in the old technology. So the last thing they wanted was to invest millions more in the new technology. Nor did they want to have to compete with other radio stations that had a superior sound and could put them out of business. So they pressured the Federal Communications Commission, the department of the United States government that regulates radio stations, to put restrictive regulations on FM radio. The result was that its use was limited to a very small area around New England. Of course as we all know, Edwin Armstrong's FM technology eventually prevailed and was adopted by thousands of stations around the world. But this took years of court battles and he never saw how it came to affect the lives of almost everyone.",

    "question": "As Dr. Miller mentioned, we're trying to recruit volunteers for the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary. But before I get into the details of the volunteer program, I'd just like to tell you a little about what we do there. One of our main jobs is to keep detailed records of the migration patterns of raptors. For those of you who don't know, raptors are birds of prey, like hawks and eagles. Between August and December, we see around twenty different species migrating from Canada and New England. About 20, 000 birds. Part of what attracts them to Hawk Mountain is the location on the East Ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. What happens is that the sun warms the ridge in such a way that air currents are formed. The birds just sort of glide along on the air, so they use up very little energy. As volunteers, you'll be helping us keep accurate counts of the raptors. Any drop in number could mean something's gone wrong in the environment because of pesticides or disease, even hunting. We just had a scare with the broad-winged hawks. Their numbers have dropped drastically over the last ten years. It was suggested that the birds may have changed their migratory route. So for 11 days we had several hundred volunteers — stationed every five miles — to observe and count. And sure enough, they discovered that instead of hugging the Appalachians as they'd always done, the broad-wings were cutting a wide path over the Delaware River. Needless to say, we were greatly relieved.",

The location of Hawk Mountain on the East Ridge of the Appalachian Mountains creates warm air currents that allow the birds to glide along with minimal energy expenditure.######In the volunteer program, participants assist in accurately counting the raptors. The importance of this task is emphasized as any decrease in numbers could indicate environmental issues such as pesticides, disease, or hunting. The lecture also mentions a recent concern regarding the significant decline in broad-winged hawk numbers over the past decade. To address this, hundreds of volunteers were stationed every five miles for eleven days to observe and count the broad-wings. It was ultimately discovered that these hawks had changed their migratory route, crossing over the Delaware River instead of hugging the Appalachians as they had previously done. This finding brought great relief to the sanctuary.######In conclusion, the lecture introduces the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary's volunteer program and emphasizes the importance of accurately counting raptors to monitor their migration patterns.

    "question": "So, you see, physical illness can have psychological causes. Now, we just have time to introduce another interesting example of the interaction between the mind and the body, placebos. Placebos — maybe you've heard them called sugar pills — are harmless substances, not always sugar, that are used routinely on groups of sick people in experiments. These experiments test the effectiveness of new drugs. One group is given the new drug, the other group is given a placebo, and the results are measured. As you might guess, some of the people who receive the new drug get better. Surprisingly, however, some of the placebo group also get better. Why? Well, it's an interesting question, one which doctors can't quite answer. Some of the group may have gotten better on their own, without any treatment at all, but research has shown that the very act of taking a medication that you think will make you better, often does make you feel better. Have you ever taken an aspirin and felt better in five minutes? Aspirin doesn't work that fast, does it? Basically, if you believe you will get better, sometimes you do. The history of how doctors and healers have used the mind-body connection to cure people is long and interesting, but I see that it's time to chose, so I'll have to cover this in the next class.

    "question": "Everyone is interested in improving their diet. Adding grains is one of the easiest ways. Many people in the United States have a growing concern about nutrition, so grains are often served in restaurants. And many grains are now available in grocery stores, too, though for some you still have to go to health food stores. You can stock up when you go, though, because uncooked grains keep a long time. You'll find that grains are easy to prepare. Many grains are as simple to cook as spaghetti. Barley, for instance, is just cooked in salted water. Remember, though, whole-grain barley, the most nutritious kind, never will get as tender as spaghetti no matter how long it's cooked. Grain-based salads are easy, too. Just use grains left over from a hot meal. You call even put together a grain salad hours before you need it, since grains don't wilt like lettuce does. But to get back to health factors, all grains are nutritious and many have special benefits. Barley has very little fat. Some experts believe that it may even reduce cholesterol levels.

    "question": "Located at the NASA Research Center in Iowa is a 5, 000- gallon vat of water, and inside the tank is an underwater treadmill designed by Dava Newman, an aerospace engineer. For four years Newman observed scuba divers as they simulated walking on the Moon and on Mars on her underwater moving belt. She wanted to discover how the gravity of the Moon and of Mars would affect human movement. To do this, Newman attached weights to the divers and then lowered them into the tank and onto the treadmill. These weights were carefully adjusted so that the divers could experience underwater the gravity of the Moon and of Mars as they walked on the treadmill. Newman concluded that walking on Mars will probably be easier than walking on the Moon. The Moon has less gravity than Mars does, so at lunar gravity, the divers struggled to keep their balance and walked awkwardly. But at Martian gravity, the divers had greater traction and stability and could easily adjust to a pace of 1.5 miles per hour. As Newman gradually increased the speed of the treadmill, the divers took longer, graceful strides until they comfortably settled into an even quicker pace. Newman also noted that at Martian gravity, the divers needed less oxygen. The data Newman collected will help in the future design of Martian space suits. Compared to lunar space suits, Martian space suits will require smaller air tanks; and, to allow for freer movement, the elbow and knee areas of the space suits will also be altered.",

    "question": "Ruth, just tell us what the Ethical Consumer Research Association is. OK, well the Ethical Consumer Research Association exists to provide information for shoppers, letting them know what the companies are doing behind the brands that they see on the shelves. So what makes an ethical shopper? Very broadly speaking, people who are concerned about ethical issues want to know that the product they're buying hasn't been made at the expense of the people who are producing it, whether it's in this country or abroad. They might also be concerned with other kinds of issues: whether the company is involved in armaments, or whether they're donating money to certain political parties. And that as a shopper, you might not want to give your money to that party so therefore you might not want to buy a product from a company who is supporting a political party that you don't agree with. And is there any kind of rule of thumb? Is something that's more expensive, for example, likely to be more ethical? Unfortunately it isn't always the case that the more expensive something is, the more ethical it is. We can buy very cheap products and it's very likely that when products are cheap, something has suffered in order to get it to us. Whether it's the person making it or the animals or the environment. Quality however, is often a good indicator whether something, especially with clothes, has been made well. And unfortunately a lot of ethical products will cost more because they reflect the real cost of bringing that thing into the shops. So something that has been made in a factory where the workers have been paid a proper wage will cost you more to buy, simply because the people making it are getting paid enough to live on. Do you have to be well off then to be an ethical shopper? It really depends. You don't have to be rich to be an ethical shopper. One way of thinking about ethical shopping is thinking about buying less. Sometimes we buy an awful lot more than we need. We buy more items of clothing than we need. So being an ethical shopper really means thinking a bit before you go and spend your money in the shops. Some things may cost a little bit more in the short-run, but be worth it in the long-run. If you are paying for quality, something will last you longer and then save you money. And sometimes you can buy things second-hand. There's a lot of charity shops on the high street to buy good clothes. Sometimes you can look a lot better than someone who's just bought off the high street because you can have quite a unique look, and the quality that you find in most second-hand shops is really very good these days. So it's about thinking before you shop. Thanks Ruth.",

Really I don't have favourite new words, but let's say that one of my favourite new words is screenager, which is a young person or a teenager who spends a lot of time in front of the computer. Any other favourites, John? Some of those rather unpleasant words like splod, somebody who is socially inept, a splody person, but as I said I don't really have favourite words because all words as far as I'm concerned are objects of scientific study. And where do these new words and phrases come from? Well, words come out of the culture that they represent and they describe so if you've got a new development in medicine, for example bird flu, then you'll get a new word coming out of that. If there's a military conflict that may well bring all sorts of new words to the fore. Going back in time the First and Second World Wars were times of great creativity of language because people from different countries met each other and exchanged their words and words developed from there. So really words come from, they come from the playground, they come from politics, they come from any area of life because every area of life is changing from day to day. How do you keep up with the huge weight of new words you must have to evaluate? Well, it's not just me, we've got something like 60 editors working on the Oxford dictionary and we also have readers and word spotters throughout the world who are sending us information in. In the old days they used to write them out on index cards when they came across some in books, but nowadays they tend to type them onto their computers and send them into the central computer here. It's an enormous issue, but one which we just about manage to keep under control. We don't include words just because we've seen one example of them we have to wait for evidence of general currency to build up in our computer files before we start putting the word in the dictionary. So a lot of the time it's collecting data, letting it build up and then reviewing it and seeing what you've got and so that's how we manage the work.",

Entirely a class distinction and people mercilessly exploit it if they want to. The truth of it is, the one way not to hold a knife at the table, is clasped in your fist, raised as if to kill your guest. And what does that tell us about eating?

That's about how you should hold your knife, because actually manners are really about the reduction of violence. There's a lot in there about reducing violence.

    "question": "The preservation of embryos and juveniles is a rate occurrence in the fossil record. The tiny, delicate skeletons are usually scattered by scavengers or destroyed by weathering before they can be fossilized. Ichthyosaurs had a higher chance of being preserved than did terrestrial creatures because, as marine animals, they tended to live in environments less subject to erosion. Still, their fossilization required a suite of factors: a slow rate of decay of soft tissues, little scavenging by other animals, a lack of swift currents and waves to jumble and carry away small bones, and fairly rapid burial. Given these factors, some areas have become a treasury of well-preserved ichthyosaur fossils. The deposits at Holzmaden, Germany, present an interesting case for analysis. The ichthyosaur remains are found in black, bituminous marine shales deposited about 190 million years ago. Over the years, thousands of specimens of marine reptiles, fish and invertebrates have been recovered from these rocks. The quality of preservation is outstanding, but what is even more impressive is the number of ichthyosaur fossils containing preserved embryos. Ichthyosaurs with embryos have been reported from 6 different levels of the shale in a small area around Holzmaden, suggesting that a specific site was used by large numbers of ichthyosaurs repeatedly over time. The embryos are quite advanced in their physical development; their paddles, for example, are already well formed. One specimen is even preserved in the birth canal. In addition, the shale contains the remains of many newborns that are between 20 and 30 inches long. Why are there so many pregnant females and young at Holzmaden when they are so rare elsewhere? The quality of preservation is almost unmatched and quarry operations have been carried out carefully with an awareness of the value of the fossils. But these factors do not account for the interesting question of how there came to be such a concentration of pregnant ichthyosaurs in a particular place very close to their time of giving birth.",

Probably nowhere in the country is this more true than at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which has needed additional space for decades and which received its last significant facelift ten years ago.

According to Ingmar Bjorksten, the cultural editor for one of the country's two major newspapers, the prize continues to represent \" what people call a very Swedish exercise: reflecting Swedish tastes. \" The Academy has defended itself against such charges of provincialism in its selection by asserting that its physical distance from the great literary capitals of the world actually serves to protect the Academy from outside influences. This may well be true, but critics respond that this very distance may also be responsible for the Academy's inability to perceive accurately 5 authentic trends in the literary world. Regardless of concerns over the selection process, however, it seems that the prize will continue to survive both as an indicator of the literature that we most highly praise, and as an elusive 8 goal that writers seek. If for no other reason, the prize will continue to be desirable for the financial rewards that accompany it; not only is the cash prize itself considerable, but it also dramatically increases sales of an author's books.",

    "question": "Before the 1850' s, the United States had a number of small colleges, most of them dating from colonial days. They were small, church connected institutions whose primary concern was to shape the moral character of their students. Throughout Europe, institutions of higher learning had developed, bearing the ancient name of university. In German university was concerned primarily with creating and spreading knowledge, not morals. Between mid-century and the end of the 1800' s, more than nine thousand young Americans, dissatisfied with their training at home, went to Germany for advanced study. Some of them return to become presidents of venerable colleges- ---- Harvard, Yale, Columbia- -- and transform them into modern universities. The new presidents broke all ties with the churches and brought in a new kind of faculty. Professors were hired for their knowledge of a subject, not because they were of the proper faith and had a strong arm for disciplining students. The new principle was that a university was to create knowledge as well as pass it on, and this called for a faculty composed of teacher-scholars. Drilling and learning by rote were replaced by the German method of lecturing, in which the professor's own research was presented in class. Graduate training leading to the Ph. D. , an ancient German degree signifying the highest level of advanced scholarly attainment, was introduced. With the establishment of the seminar system, graduate student learned to question, analyze, and conduct their own research. At the same time, the new university greatly expanded in size and course offerings, breaking completely out of the old, constricted curriculum of mathematics, classics, rhetoric, and music. The president of Harvard pioneered the elective system, by which students were able to choose their own course of study. The notion of major fields of study emerged. The new goal was to make the university relevant to the real pursuits of the world. Paying close heed to the practical needs of society, the new universities trained men and women to work at its tasks, with engineering students being the most characteristic of the new regime. Students were also trained as economists, architects, agriculturalists, social welfare workers, and teachers.",

    "question": "British Columbia is the third largest Canadian provinces, both in area and population. It is nearly 1.5 times as large as Texas, and extends 800 miles (1, 280 km ) north from the United States border. It includes Canada's entire west coast and the islands just off the coast. Most of British Columbia is mountainous, with long rugged ranges running north and south. Even the coastal islands are the remains of a mountain range that existed thousands of years ago. During the last Ice Age, this range was scoured by glaciers until most of it was beneath the sea. Its peaks now show as islands scattered along the coast. The southwestern coastal region has a humid mild marine climate. Sea winds that blow inland from the west are warmed by a current of warm water that flows through the Pacific Ocean. As a result, winter temperatures average above freezing and summers are mild. These warm western winds also carry moisture from the ocean. Inland from the coast, the winds from the Pacific meet the mountain barriers of the coastal ranges and the Rocky Mountains. As they rise to cross the mountains, the winds are cooled, and their moisture begins to fall as rain. On some of the western slopes almost 200 inches (500 cm ) of rain fall each year. More than half of British Columbia is heavily forested. On mountain slopes that receive plentiful rainfall, huge Douglas firs rise in towering columns. These forest giants often grow to be as much as 300 feet (90 m ) tall, with diameters up to 10 feet (3 m ). More lumber is produced from these trees than from any other kind of tree in North America. Hemlock, red cedar, and balsam fir are among the other trees found in British Columbia.",

Soon they are capable of nothing that they have placed five knives, spoons and forks on the table and, a bit later, that this amounts to fifteen pieces of silverware. Having thus mastered addition, they move on to subtraction. It seems almost reasonable to expect that if a child were secluded on a desert island at birth and retrieved seven years later, he or she could enter a second enter a second-grade mathematics class without any serious problems of intellectual adjustment. Of course, the truth is not so simple. This century, the work of cognitive psychologists has illuminated the subtle forms of daily learning on which intellectual progress depends.

Ecologists pointed out that a cluster of tall buildings in a city often overburdens public transportation and parking lot capacities. Skyscrapers are also lavish consumers, and wasters, of electric power. In one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscraper 1 office space in New York City raised the peak daily demand for electricity by 120, 000 kilowatts-enough to supply the entire city of Albany, New York, for a day. Glass-walled skyscrapers can be especially wasteful. The heat loss ( or gain ) through a wall of half-inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical masonry 6 wall filled with insulation board. To lessen 8 the strain on heating and air-conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double-glazed panels of glass, and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that reduce glare as well as heat gain. However, mirror-walled skyscrapers raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings. Skyscrapers put a severe strain on a city's sanitation facilities, too. If fully occupied, the two World Trade Center towers in New York City would alone generate 2.25 million gallons of raw sewage each year-as much as a city the size of Stanford, Connecticut, which has a population of more than 109, 000.",

Archaeological data are historical documents in their own right, not mere illustrations to written texts, Just as much as any other historian, an archaeologist studies and tries to reconstitute the process that has created the human world in which we live - and us ourselves in so far as we are each creatures of our age and social environment. Archaeological data are all changes in the material world resulting from human action or, more succinctly, the fossilized results of human behavior.

As such, these words and expressions are well defined and listed in standard dictionaries. Colloquialisms, on the other hand, are familiar words and idioms that are understood by almost all speakers of a language and used in informal speech or writing, but not considered appropriate for more formal situations. Almost all idiomatic expressions are colloquial language. Slang, however, refers to words and expressions understood by a large number of speakers but not accepted as good, formal usage by the majority. Colloquial expressions and even slang may be found in standard dictionaries but will be so identified. Both colloquial usage and slang are more common in speech than in writing. Colloquial speech often passes into standard speech. Some slang also passes into standard speech, but other slang expressions enjoy momentary popularity followed by obscurity. In some cases, the majority never accepts certain slang phrases but nevertheless retains them in their collective memories. Every generation seems to require its own set of words to describe familiar objects and events. It has been pointed out by a number of linguists that three cultural conditions are necessary for the creation of a large body of slang expressions. First, the introduction and acceptance of new objects and situations in the society; second, a diverse population with a large number of subgroups; third, association among the subgroups and the majority population. Finally, it is worth noting that the terms \" standard \" \" colloquial \" and \" slang \" exist only as abstract labels for scholars who study language.

    "question": "Television — the most pervasive and persuasive of modern technologies, marked by rapid change and growth-is moving into a new era, an era of extraordinary sophistication and versatility, which promises to reshape our lives and our world. It is an electronic revolution of sorts, made possible by the marriage of television and computer technologies. The word \" television \", derived 4 from its Greek ( tele: distant ) and Latin ( visio: sight ) roots, can literally 5 be interpreted as sight from a distance. Very simply put, it works in this way: through a sophisticated system of electronics, television provides the capability 6 of converting an image ( focused on a special photoconductive plate within a camera ) into electronic impulses, which can be sent through a wire or cable. These impulses, when fed into a receiver ( television set ), can then be electronically reconstituted into that same image. Television is more than just an electronic system, however. It is a means of expression, as well as a vehicle for communication, and as such becomes a powerful tool for reaching other human beings. The field of television can be divided into two categories determined by its means of transmission. First, there is broadcast television, which reaches the masses through broad-based airwave transmission of television signals. Second, there is nonbroadcast television, which provides for the needs of individuals or specific interest groups through controlled transmission techniques. Traditionally, television has been a medium of the masses. We are most familiar with broadcast television because it has been with us for about thirty-seven years in a form similar to what exists today. During those years, it has been controlled, for the most part, by the broadcast networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS, who have been the major purveyors of news, information, and entertainment.

    "question": "It is commonly believed in United States that school is where people go to get an education. Nevertheless, it has been said that today children interrupt their education to go to school. The distinction between schooling and education implied by this remark is important. Education is much more open-ended and all-inclusive than schooling. Education knows no bounds. It can take place anywhere, whether in the shower or in the job, whether in a kitchen or on a tractor. It includes both the formal learning that takes place in schools and the whole universe of informal learning. The agents of education can range from a revered grandparent to the people debating politics on the radio, from a child to a distinguished scientist. Whereas schooling has a certain predictability, education quite often produces surprises. A chance conversation with a stranger may lead a person to discover how little is known of other religions. People are engaged in education from infancy on. Education, then, is a very broad, inclusive term. It is a lifelong process, a process that starts long before the start of school, and one that should be an integral part of one's entire life. Schooling, on the other hand, is a specific, formalized process, whose general pattern varies little from one setting to the next. Throughout a country, children arrive at school at approximately the same time, take assigned seats, are taught by an adult, use similar textbooks, do homework, take exams, and so on. The slices of reality that are to be learned, whether they are the alphabet or an understanding of the working of government, have usually been limited by the boundaries of the subject being taught.

Professional singers and players have great responsibilities, for the composer is utterly dependent on them. A student of music needs as long and as arduous a training to become a performer as a medical student needs to become a doctor. Most training is concerned with technique, for musicians have to have the muscular proficiency of an athlete or a ballet dancer. Singers practice breathing every day, as their vocal chords would be inadequate without controlled muscular support. String players practice moving the fingers of the left hand up and down, while drawing the bow to and fro with the right arm-two entirely different movements. Singers and instruments have to be able to get every note perfectly 7 in tune. Pianists are spared this particular anxiety, for the notes are already there, waiting for them, and it is the piano tuner's responsibility to tune the instrument for them. But they have their own difficulties; the hammers that hit the string have to be coaxed not to sound like percussion, and each overlapping tone has to sound clear. This problem of getting clear texture is one that confronts student conductors: they have to learn to know every note of the music and how it should sound, and they have to aim at controlling these sound with fanatical but selfless authority.

So the rats that do a lot of licking and grooming and their last rats that rule very little. But most rats are in between. So that resembles a human human behavious as well, right, you have mothers that are highly mothering and mothers that couldn't care less and most mothers are somewhere in between. So if you look at these rats. So all you do you observe them and put them in separate cages. So you put the high lickers in one cage not the mothers, but the offspring and the low lickers in another cage and then you let them grow and they're adults now, their mothers are long buried and you look in the brain and you see that those who had high licking mothers express a lot of glucocorticoid receptor, gene and though so our lawmakers express know that reflects a number of factors and that results in a different stress response, but this is not the only difference. We found later on there are hundreds of genes that are differently expressed. So if you get in a mutation, you know polymorphism once in a million. Here, just the motherly lauching just hundreds of genes in one shot and it changes them in a very stable way that you can look at the old rat and you can say whether it was licked or not. But you can also save by behavior. So if you walk to the cages to the room the rats that were poorly lit are highly anxious, hard to handle, aggressive, and, and the rats that were very well handled as as off as little pups.

These provide the spark that will ignite your sample when your sample burns or combust that gives off energy. So how is the energy collected or how did a scientist figure out how much energy is being given off. Well, it ’ s a closed system, there ’ s a lid here that goes on top of this calorimeter and what ’ s in here in the lid is a stirrer. The stir is going to stir the water. That ’ s in this big pool here so that the heat given off from the sample is going to warm the water in a uniform way. This is the temperature probe, this goes down in the water also and measures the change in temperature because as the sample is burned, it will give off heat and the temperature the water will increase. So the lid goes on the sample is prepared. The last thing that you need to make a combustion reaction happen is oxygen and at some point during the process, some oxygen is added by a tank.

    "question": "The key to forming strong brain architecture is what's known as \" serve and return \" interaction with adults. In this developmental game, new neural connections form in the brain as young children instinctively serve through babbling, facial expressions, and gestures, and adults return the serve, responding in a very directed, meaningful way. It starts very early in life when a baby coos and the adults interacts and directs the baby's attention to a face or hand. This interaction forms the foundation of brain architecture upon which all future development will be built. It helps create neural connections between all the different areas of the brain, building the emotional and cognitive skills children need in life. For example, here's how it works for literacy and language skills. When the baby sees an object, the adult says its name. This makes connections in the baby's brain between particular sounds and their corresponding objects. Later, adults show young children that those objects and sounds can also be represented by marks on a page. With continued support from adults, children then learn how to decipher writing and, eventually, to write themselves. Each stage builds on what came before. Ensuring that children have adult caregivers who consistently engage in serve and return interaction, beginning in infancy, builds the foundation in the brain for all the learning, behavior, and health that follow.",

It ’ s a back-and - forth interaction. The brain is a highly integrated organ which has multiple sections that specialize in different kind of processes, so we have parts of the brain that are involved more in cognitive function and other parts that are involved in processing of emotion and parts involved in seeing and hearing. So if a child is emotionally kind of … well … put together and socially competent, that will affect more positive and productive learning.

    "question": "Alexis de Tocqueville, as we have noted, appears to have had some appeal to both ends of the political spectrum — left and right. Or rather, both have found him to be useful for their purposes in certain circumstances. His rational acceptance of the new forces of democracy brought about by the American and French revolutions made him an icon of left-wing liberals. However, during the Cold War - that is, from the end of World War II until the collapse of communism - he was adopted by some leading thinkers on the right. So, there are two sides to his political philosophy, and the man himself that we need to look at. Now, I would suggest that de Tocqueville's biography is important here. You must always bear in mind when reading him that he was an aristocrat, and one whose family had suffered in the French Revolution. He wasn't your typical aristocrat because his politics differed from others of his family and social rank. He abandoned the Catholic church and married beneath his class. Yet he never quite threw off the prejudices of that class. However, and what is important, he did recognize and believe that the tendency of history, which in those days could be traced back to the Middle Ages, was towards the leveling of social ranks, and more equal and democratic conditions. The French Revolution had in the end brought Napoleon, whom he hated, but democracy would inevitably come to France. His trip to America was to see democracy in practice, make note of its shortcomings and errors, and then find safeguards against them.",

In another lecture, I'm going to deal with what we must no megalopolis - cities with populations of ten million or more. However, first I want to go back in history to when the population of cities could be numbered in the thousands rather than millions. One of the earliest theorists of the city was, of course, Plato, who created an ideal city in his text, The Republic. The population of this city would be around twenty-five to thirty thousand at most. Oddly enough, the same figures were chosen by Leonardo da Vinci for his ideal cities. Now, of these twenty five to thirty inhabitants only about five thousand would be citizens. A reason for this might be that it is the largest number that could be addressed publicly at one time and by one person, and makes a voting system much easier to manage. Also, perhaps the numbers are kept deliberately low because a large population would be harder to control, or because, in practical terms, fewer inhabitants are easier to feed from local supplies without having to depend on outside sources.",

Now the power that the turbine creates is obviously depended on the wind speed, it also depended obviously on the number of sails, the area of the sails and the angle of the sails makes to the wind. So you can imagine if the turbine blades flat onto the wind, the wind's going to just bend it, if there is slight angle when the wind hits it, it's going to turn the blades. We can use that for powering things.

Did they have a voice, apart, that is, from what we can gather from graffiti? The usual picture is one of time spent at festivals, baths and, typically, the games. However, for many Romans, terrible living conditions, poverty, debt and the chance of being sold into slavery at any moment - that is, if they weren't slaves already - left no time or energy for such forms of entertainment, or for any interestin politics, for that matter. Indeed, after the death of Augustus, executive power was taken from the elected assemblies of the Roman people. Now it was the emperor's job to look after the people, and his generosity often depended on the mood and behavior of the people - on how often and how violently they protested and rioted. One example would be clauctius ensuring a steady grain supply, even in winter, after rioters pelted him with stale crusts of bread. There is an anecdote about, urn, Hadrian.

    "question": "We appear to take it as a rule, or as a law of nature, that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home. For example, species from the Arctic, or even a temperate region, could not survive in a tropical climate, nor could a tropical species last long if it found itself at the South Pole. But it is true to say there's too much emphasis placed on the degree of adaptation of species to the climates where they live. We assume that this adaptation - if all species are descended from a single form - must have taken place over millions of years, yet a large number of plants and animals brought from different countries remain perfectly healthy in their new home. Also, there are several examples of an imal species that have extended their range, within historical times, from warmer to cooler latitudes and the other way round. Rats and mice provide good examples: they have been transported by man to many parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, and they can be found living in the cold climate of the Faroe Islands to the north through the tropical zones to the Falklands in the south. It is possible to see adaptation to any climate as a quality that is part of an inborn flexibility of the physical and mental constitution of most animals. Therefore, the ability to survive in the most different climates by both man and his domestic animals, and the fact that elephants once existed in an ice age while living species live in tropical areas, should not be seen as deviations from the rule, but as examples of this flexibility being brought into action under particular circumstances.",

    "question": "So today we're going to talk about children's literature and the role it plays in society. Throughout history adults have used the power of stories to entertain and amuse their children. But stories are not used merely to entertain youngsters, they have a significant educational purpose. They serve to teach the moral values of their society. In sociological terms, stories are one of the means by which children are socialized. How does this work in practice? Well, it often makes use of heroes, the characters in the stories who the children will admire and want to be like. The heroes of children's stories, therefore, exemplify the qualities valued by that society - they will typically demonstrate courage in the face of difficulty, honesty, consideration for others, loyalty to their family and friends, a respect for work and so on. You can see this happening from the fables of ancient societies through fairy tales and folk tales right up to modern day children's stories. For example, the hard-working ant in Aesop's fable is shown to succeed in comparison with the grasshopper who spends the summer singing and has nothing to eat when winter comes.

    "question": "Today's economy: materials are extracted, products manufactured, used and thrown away at as low a cost as possible. This cycle is not only polluting, it is unsustainable in a planet with limited resources. But, it can be improved. Have you heard about the circular economy? Products stay in the economy for longer, and at the end of their life they are reused, repaired, remanufactured, upgraded or recycled. Truly creating a circular economy could give a 1.8 trillion Euro boost to the European economy. That's the same amount as Italy's entire economy. It would also be good for the environment: reducing the damaging extraction of raw materials, improving air quality by reducing incineration and preventing toxic residues leaking into the soil through landfill waste sites. But what about people? It is estimated that for every 10, 000 tonnes of waste: 1 job can be created if that waste is incinerated, 6 jobs if it is landfilled, 36 if it is recycled and 296 if it is reused. Examples from all around Europe show that when people and social enterprises are able to get involved in the circular economy, the social, environmental and financial benefits are enjoyed by all. On 2 December, the European Commission published the circular economy package, which places people at a secondary level. The Greens are calling for a better integration of people's interests in the circular economy, such as stronger support for citizen's initiatives and social enterprises and a stronger focus on green job creation.

    "question": "The American people are fed up with partisan politics. In a recent Gallup poll Americans named dissatisfaction with government as the number one problem facing our country today. Americans now believe our government is has more problems from economy, education and terrorism. To change the way our elected officials work for the American people, we must change how they are elected. We need to start with the first round of voting, the primaries. Thanks to gerrymandering and other factors, the primary election is often the only election that matters. In many states, less than 5% of the electorate are actually deciding who represents 100% of that district or state. That means that our elected officials are being chosen by an increasingly tiny, often incredibly partisan slice of the electorate. Today 42% of Americans identify themselves as independents. Most states include independent voters from voting in the first round, the primaries. And in states that do allow them to vote in primaries, they are forced to temporarily join a party that they don't believe in. A Top Two nonpartisan primary eliminates party control in favor of a single, nonpartisan primary open to all voters and all candidates. There is no longer a Democratic primary and a Republican primary, there is one primary open to all voters and all candidates. The top two vote getters, regardless of party, then move forward to the general election. With nonpartisan primaries everyone gets to vote. The winners are more accountable, because they have to speak to all the voters in order to get elected. Elections are more competitive. Legislators are encouraged to work across party lines and focus on issues we care about. Top Two nonpartisan primaries are now used in California, Washington and Nebraska at the state level. You've probably already voted using Top Two. Most municipal elections nationwide use this simple, nonpartisan system. Today, activists in all 50 states are working to bring this crucial system change to their state. The movement is growing.

    "question": "Viatamin E supplementation confirmed as a treatment for liver problems. Hi, I'm Doctor James Meschino. There is a fatty liver condition known as NASH. That is commonly seen in diabetics, pre-diabetics and people who are overweight. NASH stands for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a condition where you have an inflamed liver that is not caused by alcohol consumption. It is caused b faulty lifestyle behaviors, lots of fat in the diet in particular. Of course, alcohol consumption can also induce fatty liver problems. But with the obesity epidemic that we have at hand, more and more people are developing fatty liver disease, not from alcohol but from faulty dietary lifestyle patterns and lack of exercise. If it is left unchecked, fatty liver problems can degenerate into cirrhosis. In cirrhosis of the liver, you are getting scar tissue and fibrotic tissue. Nodules start to replace normal liver tissue. With advancing cirrhosis, you can end up with liver failure, requiring a liver transplant. Cirrhosis is the tenth leading cause of death in men in our society. It is the twelfth leading cause of death in women in our society as of 2001. In 2012, new medical guidelines were issued for the management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. One of the major recommendations was 800 IUs of vitamin E every day. Why? Well, vitamin E is one of the few agents that has been shown to actually reverse some of the liver damage in people that have this problem. Other studies have also shown recently that vitamin E is linked to prevention of liver cancer in people who are high risk for primary liver cancer.

    "question": "How much sun exposure might one need to get their target vitamin D level to that found associated with the lowest total mortality rate? Well, it depends. It depends on our age, how long we're exposed, the time of day, the time of the year, our latitude, our skin color, our use of sunscreen, and how much of our body we're exposing. Even in Boston, though, all it takes is 10-12 minutes of mid-day summer sun without sunblock, if you're a young pale naked Caucasian. But then you're golden! Actually, you'd be a little pink. Note though, if you are some old white guy prancing around naked on the Commons, you're not going to make it. As I hope you are beginning to appreciate, it's not easy to make one-size fits all recommendations for how much sun exposure one might need. And Low vitamin D status despite abundant sun exposure has been found even in the best of circumstances: young half naked skateboarders in Honolulu, mostly Caucasian, averaging 30 hours of sun a week, and 51% didn't even make it to 30. If they can't, who can? And these days, even if we're an albino nudist at the equator, how often might we be getting outside in middle of the day with a desk job? So, if we're really interested in getting to the vitamin D level associated with the lowest mortality rates, and our lifestyle or latitude won't allow us the necessary sun exposure, then one needs to take vitamin D supplements: the piddly amount added to soymilk, calf-milk, margarine or mushrooms are simply not enough.",

However, in Boston, for a young pale naked Caucasian, 10-12 minutes of mid-day summer sun without sunscreen is sufficient. It is important to note that these recommendations may not apply to everyone, as older individuals or those with different skin types may require different levels of exposure.######In conclusion, determining the exact amount of sun exposure needed to reach optimal vitamin D levels is challenging as it varies depending on individual factors and circumstances. Additionally, even with adequate sun exposure, low vitamin D status can still occur. In such cases, taking vitamin D supplements may be necessary as the amount of vitamin D added to certain foods is insufficient to reach desired levels.",

Why is it that some people work hard and do well while others can work just as hard and don't, why some are committed to what they are doing and others aren't? Finding answers to this question would be extremely useful to educators, as well as in other areas of life. Businesses, for example, have long believed that financial incentives - bonuses, perks, pay rises - are the great motivators, and to an extent they can make a difference, but what we are calling the mind set is more important. What has made it difficult to find out what the causes of motivation are, is that motivation and the capacity for hard work can be mistaken for talent - thinking it's a gift. Either you've got it or you haven't People who believe this have a fixed mind set and are not only going to perform less well than they could, but it's also an attitude that will affect their whole Outlook on life.

On the other hand, there are photographs which, to my mind, are far more thought-provoking and have greater emotional impact than a painting of the same subject could. Some people say that the traditional idea of an artist with a trained hand and eye is old-fashioned. They no longer believe that an artist needs specialist knowledge, but rather that he or she can simply point a camera at a scene and recordit. However, on the one hand, that ignores the creative skill involved in producing photographs. On the other hand, it also ignores the fact that even in the past, painters used various technological aids. For example, the Dutch painter, Vermeer, used a camera obscura to help him create his images. We'll go into that later, but for now, J want to look at the documentary and cultural value of photography.",

It peaks at night. We call it as the darkness hormone. In every species that we studied, melatonin occurs at night. And it's hormone that prepares you for the things, that your species, does at night. So, of course, in humans we sleep, but animals, like rodents, they are awake.

In fact, I started doing biology precisely to avoid matlls and physics. So, I've had a lot of catching up to do. We are all aware of how the sciences have come to inter-relate more and more, and not only will mathematics impinge more and more on biology but also, I am told, in the 21\" century, the driving force behind mathematics will be biology. This is partly because mathematicians are always on the look out for more areas to conquer. But a far greater reason is that the subject has been boiled down to physics and chemistry - obvious attractions for mathematicians. A number of mathematical fields can be applied to biology. For example, knot theory is used in the analysis of the tangled strands of DNA, and abstract geometry in four or more dimensions is used to tell us about viruses. Again, neuroscience appears to be mathsfriendly and equations can also explain why hallucinogenic drugs cause the users to see spirals.

And when I say ' space' I'm talking about space within a dwelling or home rather than the actual size of residential areas. There's growing concern that the internal space of new homes is becoming far smaller. Too small, in fact. Maybe you're thinking: Is it important for residents to have sufficient space? Is it merely a preference to have more space or are there more serious implications? Is there, in fact, any evidence to suggest cramped living conditions affect residents' physical or mental well-being or their day to day life? Well, research from a number of sources indicates that this is an important issue which needs addressing. Cramped conditions can lead to aggressive behaviour, to family tensions, psychological anguish and, in the more extreme cases, physical illness as well. Not only this but there is a proven link between overcrowding and the social and emotional development of children as well as their educational attainment. So, the main issue here is that residents require enough individual space to be able to live and function together but with sufficient private space for personal time within the home.",

Despite the fact that a minority of educators don't agree with this practice, it has never seriously been questioned or challenged before. However, it may be that the tide is turning. These days, more people are becoming convinced that homework is of virtually no benefit, particularly for children in the younger age group. So, why have teachers always given homework? Well, the answer seems to be because they are obliged to. Most teachers don't really believe it has any real value. And the latest research supports the teachers' feelings about this. Not only does homework have very little impact on children's learning but it also puts unnecessary obligations and responsibilities onto the parents. These days not all families have the time or the necessary knowledge to help their offspring. So it would seem that now, senior educators want to start a new initiative. Rather than giving homework, they plan to encourage reading books of any kind, just reading. and they claim that this is a far more effective method of consolidating learning than wading through piles of written homework.",

    "question": "What I want to look at today is the question of how much technology - If, um, a pen can indeed be called technology. . . perhaps I should say the instrument of writing - affects a writer's style and level of production. I also want to consider other factors that may have an effect on prose style, such as personality, educational background, and so on. Now, production levels aren't so hard to measure in relation to the writing instrument used. The quill pen, for instance, would need continual re-filling and resharpening, which led to a leisurely, balanced style of prose full of simple sentences. Writing took a lot longer than now and the great novelists of the 18\" century - Fielding, Smollett, Richardson - had a relatively small output, though some of their books ran to enormous length. By the middle of the 19' h century, the fountain pen had been invented. It didn't need such constant refilling, which can account for the more flowing, discursive style of, say, Dickens and Thackeray, as well as their tremendous output. Then came the typewriter, whose purpose, once you got the hang of it, was to speed up the writing process and was therefore much favored by journalists. This, it seems to me, gave rise to a short winded style characterized by short sentences. A short prose style, if you like. Dictating machines and tape recorders led, as one novelist complained, to writers becoming too conversational, rambling and long winded. Henry James, although he didn't use these machines, dicta ted his later novels and, well, some might agree with this accusation.

Although we tend to think of electric cars as being something completely modern, they were in fact some of the earliest types of motorized vehicle. At the beginning of the twentieth century electric cars were actually more popular than cars with an internal combustion engine as they were more comfortable to ride in. However, as cars fuelled by petrol increased in importance, electric cars declined. The situation became Such that electric vehicles were only used for certain specific purposes - as fork-lift trucks, ambulances and urban delivery vehicles, for example. Although electricity declined in use in road vehicles, it steadily grew in importance as a means of powering trains. Switzerland, for example, was quick to develop an electrified train system, encouraged in this no doubt by the fact that it had no coal or oil resources of its own. Nowadays there is renewed interest in electricity as a means of powering road vehicles. Why is this the case? Well, undoubtedly economic reasons are of considerable importance. The cost of oil has risen so sharply that there is a strong financial imperative to look for an alternative. However, there are also environmental motivations.

However, electric vehicles have remained in use for specific purposes such as fork-lift trucks, ambulances, and urban delivery vehicles. Meanwhile, electricity has steadily grown in importance as a power source for trains, especially in countries like Switzerland.######In recent times, there has been renewed interest in using electricity to power road vehicles. This is primarily driven by economic reasons, as the cost of oil has risen significantly, creating a financial incentive to seek alternative sources of energy. Additionally, environmental motivations play a role, as car emissions are associated with the destruction of the ozone layer and increased temperatures in polar regions. The desire to prevent further damage to the environment has also led to increased research in designing effective electric transportation.######In conclusion, there is a growing focus on electric vehicles as a response to economic and environmental concerns, with the aim of finding a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation.",

    "question": "Conduct disorder in children is very serious. It's a disorder of childhood and adolescence that is long term, that's chronic, where children have very aggressive impulses, where children are involved in difficulties with the law and really seem to have no regard for the rules or for authority. When children have conduct disorder they are definitely at risk of carrying these difficulties into adulthood which also brings about a myriad of different problems. Children with conduct disorder often have difficulties in schools, have difficulty with relationships and have difficulty with employment and lifelong long-term relationships. It's important to recognize that if your child is not doing well in school, if your child has had difficulty where legal action was necessary, if your child is bullying, getting into fights and this is constant and ongoing, if your child does not get help these complexities will really exacerbate into other major difficulties. Look for signs of your child's grades dropping, look for signs of repeated detentions, suspensions and brushes with the law. Parents please recognize that if your child has signs of conduct disorder the sooner you get help, the sooner your child can start to learn more adaptive behaviors.",

    "question": "From reading philosophy, I came up with three principles as the guiding principles for a just city, of the principles of equity, democracy and diversity. Of these were derived from the works of a number of philosophers, most preeminently I supposed on Ross. My choice of word equity rather than equality is in fact based on Ross's argument that a policy ought to distribute benefits to people where the worst off become better off. So the worst off don't have to become equal to everybody else but no policy should in fact make those who are most disadvantaged more disadvantaged. And it means that we have to talk about the policy at the time it's being enacted. To say, while we have to make our city more competitive because sometime and by and by, the benefits will trickle down to those people who were worst off doesn't justify making them worst off as that time. We have a lot of examples on the world of people whose homes were destroyed in the name of the greater good and say eventually they will benefit. But equity means that you do not in fact take advantage of those people who are weakest.",

The choice of the word \"equity\" instead of \"equality\" is based on Ross's argument that a policy should aim to improve the well-being of the worst off, rather than making them equal to everyone else. It is important to consider the impact of policies at the time they are enacted, as it is not justified to make the most disadvantaged even more disadvantaged in the hope that they will eventually benefit.######In conclusion, the principles of equity, democracy, and diversity should guide decisions in creating a just city. Equity ensures that the weakest members of society are not taken advantage of, while democracy ensures the inclusion and participation of all citizens. Diversity further enriches the city by promoting a multitude of perspectives and experiences.",

    "question": "In today's lecture I'm going to talk about changes in air pollution since the middle of the last century and what has created these changes. So, um — by the 1950 s, air pollution was very visible with frequent thick black fogs known as ' smogs' in many large cities around the world. The main source of this pollution was from factories and it caused severe health problems. For example, a particularly severe smog in London in 1952 caused over four thousand deaths. Obviously something had to be done and in 1956 a Clean Air Act was introduced in Britain. This addressed the pollution from factories and the smogs soon disappeared. However, as you know, these days air pollution is still a big issue. The main difference between now and the 1950 s is that you can't see it — it's invisible. Also, the main source of pollution now is from cars and lorries, and although these don't produce visible signs, this air pollution is still a significant risk to health. And one of the key factors in the rise of this type of pollution is that we have all become much more vehicle-dependent. There are far more cars and lorries, trains and planes than in the 1950 s and this is now the main source of air pollution around the world.",

    "question": "Super-symmetry is a mathematical idea that people have developed an effort to understand the sharpest organising principle for the fundamental constituents of matter. You see, we have learned that particles that seem to be different, can actually secretly be united by certain symmetry principles. So we use the fact that there are symmetric objects in the world like a sphere or basketball. You turn a sphere, and even though you've transformed it, it looks the same fundamentally. We found that certain particles when you transform one particle into another, even though looks like the identity of the particle has changed, overall the equations describing it they don't change at all at an underlying level of symmetry, but we've not been able to do is find a symmetry that would relate certain kinds of particles, namely matter particles and force particles. Matter particles are particles like electron, muons and corks, force particles are like photons and gluons and WZ bosons. Super-symmetry is a symmetry that actually relates to these two kinds, these two classes of particles. And people have proven that super-symmetry is the last possible symmetry of the fundamental particles that are mathematics, reality has not yet been shown to make use of it. So people are now trying to see whether that symmetry might actually be working in the world can be found evidence for it in our understanding of fundamental particles.",

    "question": "Hello everyone. Today's lecture is about setting up a website. I'm going to be focusing on things that you need to consider to ensure your website really adds value to the people using it. So - there are three main areas you need to think about. The first and most important thing is who is your target audience? When you're creating a new website you really need to think about who the users are and what information they'll be looking for. What we do when we set up websites is to group users based on their needs. So, for a website in the academic community, for example, we may have groups such as researchers and administrators, and this helps us design the site and add information that is relevant to each group. The second point is accessibility. The main thing here is to ensure your website can be found. And you can do this by making sure it can be reached from areas on the web where your target audience are also active. So this may mean providing links on other websites or maybe using social media. And thirdly - retention-making sure your target audience return to your website regularly. You do this by ensuring it gives them a reason to come back.

    "question": "So there are two theories for how the gas giants formed. One is the same theory I showed you just now core accretion, right. And the other is called disk instability and one of our colleagues at DTM has done a lot of work on that and so it's unclear exactly how they formed but you're right what we're trying to do the reason we're trying to get the higher and higher pressure in the lab is because we are trying to understand more about the pressure inside the gas giants. It's thought that the gas giants also have a metallic core, but maybe the metallic core not made of iron. Hydrogen, for example becomes metallic at a certain pressure. So it's very possible that the insides of these planets could have metallic cores, could have hydrogen cores, could have rocky portions we're not sure. But the higher pressure we can get in the lab, the closer we can get understanding the interiors of the gas giants and the exoplanet that are so big.",
