It is the keystone that supports not just academic success, but holistic well-being. A balanced lifestyle incorporates proper nutrition, which fuels both body and mind, essential for optimal cognitive function and energy levels. The American College Health Association reports that students who consume a balanced diet perform better academically than those who do not. Equally crucial is physical activity. Regular exercise releases endorphins, known as the'feel-good'hormones, which reduce stress and anxiety. In a study by the Journal of Exercise Science & Fitness, students who engaged in regular physical activity had significantly lower stress levels. By intertwining good nutrition and regular exercise into our daily routines, we forge a foundation of health that sustains us through our studies and beyond.

Most likely, you looked at a tree or plant and noticed details about its leaves and assessed the qualities of sunlight streaming outside. Observing the timing of biological events in relation to changes in season and climate is called “ phenology ”. When you notice the daffodil buds are poking through the snow and think spring is on its way, you ’ re using phenology. When you see leaves turn from green to red, and watch migrating birds fly past, and realize that summer is over, autumn is here, you ’ re using phenology. Literally meaning, “ the science of appearance ”, phenology comes from the Greek words “ pheno, ” to show or appear, and “ logos, ” to study. Humans have relied on phenology since the time of hunters and gatherers. We ’ ve watched changes in seasons to know when to plant and harvest food and when to track migrating animals. Scientists observe and document seasonal changes in nature and look for patterns in the timing of seasonal events. Timing of these natural signs has remained consistent until recently. Increasing global temperature is causing rhythms of nature to shift. Bud burst, the day when a tree or plant ’ s leaf or flower buds open, is occurring earlier in the year for some species.

    "question": "While a written word might have multiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended meaning through context. In speech however, a word can take on additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, the relationship between speakers, and expectations of where a conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler with vital information. This is where “ um ” and “ uh ” come in. Or “ eh ” and “ ehm, ” “ tutoa ” and “öö, ” “ eto ” and “ ano. ” Linguists call these filled pauses, which are a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly insignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful in spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause might be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal that you ’ re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your speech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word for a situation. And they don ’ t just benefit the speaker — a filled pause lets your listeners know an important word is on the way. Linguists have even found that people are more likely to remember a word if it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena aren ’ t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue.

So we gonna look at how we recognize human faces and how we do it quite as well as we do. We're really expert at recognizing faces. So again we can think about how do we take that visual information and how do we transform it into a form which allows us to put a name to a face, and to do all the other clever things that we can do with faces. So I'm gonna start off again by just pointing out that it's a hard problem. Face recognition is a hard problem, and it's a clever thing we do.

    "question": "Why can ’ t we transplant brains? First of all, we should look at what the brain actually does. This thing inside our skulls that weighs on average about 3.3 pounds is larger in humans than any other vertebrae when compared to body weight. That ’ s why we are so brainy. The busy brain is our command center for our nervous system, which takes in data from our body and gives directions to our muscles. In fact, it does so much work, it requires about 20 percent of our energy to run it. When we are brain dead, we no longer have any neurological activity. With the help of machines, we can be kept alive for a short time, but within a week, the body will not be able to function. While we may still be alive in some sense for that week, we are technically dead when the brain is dead. Some good news is that during the time we are kept alive, some of our other organs can be donated. But why can ’ t we accept someone else ’ s brain? When we transplant something such as a heart, surgeons use a mechanical pump to keep blood flooding through the body while the new heart is being put in. The new heart is then connected to the major blood vessels, and this might take several hours. You ’ ll stay in the hospital for one to two weeks, and if your body doesn ’ t reject its new heart, it ’ s said 87 out of 100 people make it through the year, and 60 out of 100 get through another decade. So, wouldn ’ t it just be possible to open the skull and connect a new brain where the removed brain was connected? This question was asked to a Professor of Neurosurgery at Yale in 2013. He actually did say that one day this operation might be successful, but right now we are not even close. The reason is because it ’ s just too darn difficult to connect nerve fibers from the new brain to the native spinal cord. This, he said, is why spinal cord injuries can be so devastating. If we could transplant brains, we would likely not have so many people that are disabled due to spinal injuries.",

    "question": "But what exactly happens to your body when you ’ re in a coma? First we have to be clear that comas are very different from sleep. Despite the fact that the origin of the word comes from the Greek for Koma, or deep sleep, comas are not sleep however and are instead various forms of unconsciousness that render a person unable to respond to any external stimuli. You can play the loudest, heaviest death metal in the world right next to someone who ’ s comatose, and you won ’ t succeed in doing anything except really annoying the neighbors. Likewise you can even physically hurt people in a coma and they will remain completely oblivious and unresponsive. In times not too distant past, this was sometimes used as treating, with doctors trying to shock their victims back into consciousness. Everything was tried from exposing parts of the body to open flames to severely dropping the body ’ s temperature with ice, to even bloodletting from the head directly. One treatment even included wholly emptying the stomach, we guess because the doctors thought that if a patient got hungry enough, the body would force them to wake up. Or maybe they really were just throwing everything including the kitchen sink at the problem, which we ’ re sure was also tried. Comas can occur as a result of serious trauma or as a deliberate medical treatment by doctors. They are typically brought on by traumatic head injury, and it ’ s believed that it ’ s the brain ’ s way of shutting down so it can focus on repairing itself. They can also however be brought on by a stroke, a brain tumor, drug or alcohol abuse, or an illness such as diabetes or an infection. Most of the time a coma only lasts a few weeks though, but past this period the patient can enter a persistent vegetative state that severely lessens their chances of ever coming back out of one.",

    "question": "We ’ ve all heard the phrase “ Laughter is the best medicine. ” But why do we laugh in the first place? It seems that laughing might be a little more hard-wired into us than you might think. Infants laugh very early in life, usually learning how to laugh before they can speak. Not only that, but people that are born blind and deaf can still exhibit laughter. One study found that the laughter produced from deaf participants was fundamentally similar to that produced by normally hearing individuals, backing up the idea that laughter is grounded in human biology. It ’ s also been theorized that laughter predates human speech by potentially millions of years, being a simpler form of communication. Laughter is thought to have likely helped earlier people negotiate group dynamics and establish hierarchy. I can ’ t even imagine trying to explain that I ’ m a little goofball using only laughter! So if laughter actually is instinctually part of humans, then why do people laugh? It seems like laughter is more of a way for people to better handle stress and make situations feel less threatening than laughter only being about things that we find to be funny. In practice, with a study of 1, 200 people that laughed spontaneously in their natural environments, only about 10-20 percent of the laughing episodes followed anything the researchers found to be joke-like. Finding something funny still seems to play a part in why we laugh some of the time, but laughing to make yourself feel better about your next difficult exam might be just as probable as cracking up over that joke you just heard.",

    "question": "Well, according to the American Psychiatric Association, addiction is a complex condition of the brain where a person has compulsive substance use despite there being harmful consequences. People with addiction tend to have an intense focus on what they ’ re addicted to, to the point where it takes over their life. What makes it so hard to break an addiction is that it can change the way your brain is wired, giving you harsh cravings that make it difficult to stop. Studies of brain imaging have even shown changes in areas of the brain that relate to judgement, decision making, learning, memory, and behavior control. So is this what ’ s happening with Facebook and social media? It ’ s hard to say for sure. That being said, we are starting to give more credit to an addiction that might be pretty similar: video games. That ’ s because the American Psychiatric Association includes Internet Gaming Disorders as disorders that requires further research, but that can result in clinically significant impairment or distress. The World Health Organization has also added Gaming disorders to their International Classification of Diseases, which is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions. Now online video games are obviously not the same as a site like Facebook, yet they do have similar social aspects. It ’ s possible that in the future we ’ ll see health organizations also classifying social media as a type of addiction or disorder. Still, sites like Facebook do have quite a few qualities that make you want to come back to them. Through constant feeds that go on forever and giving you push notifications on your phone, social media sites try their best to keep you on their app or website, and if you leave they want you to come back as quickly as possible. Google and Facebook further their reach by also being commonly used to sign into other sites.

    "question": "Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads. But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed greatly across cultures, the practice is as old as civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian mummy dating back to 6, 000 BCE. But have you ever wondered how tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40, 000 skin cells per hour. That ’ s about 1, 000, 000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn ’ t gradually flake off along with them? The simple answer is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods to accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison ’ s engraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles, loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50 to 3, 000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers, nerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells to the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent.",

It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth ’ s surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO 2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth.

    "question": "But for these things that we actually do really care about and do experience profound regret around, what does that experience feel like? We all know the short answer. It feels terrible. Regret feels awful. But it turns out that regret feels awful in four very specific and consistent ways. So the first consistent component of regret is basically denial. When I went home that night after getting my tattoo, I basically stayed up all night. And for the first several hours, there was exactly one thought in my head. And the thought was, “ Make it go away! ” This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response. I mean, it ’ s right up there with, “ I want my mommy! ” We ’ re not trying to solve the problem. We ’ re not trying to understand how the problem came about. We just want it to vanish. The second characteristic component of regret is a sense of bewilderment. So the other thing I thought about there in my bedroom that night was, “ How could I have done that? What was I thinking? ” This real sense of alienation from the part of us that made a decision we regret. We can ’ t identify with that part. We don ’ t understand that part. And we certainly don ’ t have any empathy for that part — which explains the third consistent component of regret, which is an intense desire to punish ourselves. That ’ s why, in the face of our regret, the thing we consistently say is, “ I could have kicked myself. ” The fourth component here is that regret is what psychologists call perseverative. To perseverate means to focus obsessively and repeatedly on the exact same thing. Now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop. So it ’ s not that I sat there in my bedroom that night, thinking, “ Make it go away. ” It ’ s that I sat there and I thought, “ Make it go away. Make it go away. Make it go away.

After investing more than 9 billion dollars into their solar energy objective, Morocco aims to create 4 additional plants similar to this one in the Sahara that will collectively create more than 2000 megawatts of electricity production which will be enough to provide for roughly 38% of all of Morocco ’ s annual electricity needs. This project will transform Morocco into the world ’ s leading solar energy state, and as the only African country that currently has a power cable linked to Europe, much of this energy will be exported for profit to the countries of the European Union. But all of this energy is created from just five relatively small plants.",

    "question": "Sometimes ignorance is preferable to the detailed truth. Maybe, we only care about truth in so far as it empowers us: knowing and thinking about all of the details of every orange tree would just be a psychological burden for the most of us. I ’ ll take illusion over the reality. But I can ’ t help but ask, “ Is it possible that the mind is actually accessing a deeper kind of truth? ” Maybe, the mind is separating the signal from the noise. But, what constitutes signal versus noise? Our values. A farmer that values knowing all the details of an orange tree will view it differently than a regular person. Well, where do our values come from? Here ’ s Nietzsche ’ s view from Beyond Good and Evil: “ Behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there too stand valuations or, more clearly, physiological demands for the preservation of a certain type of life. ” For Nietzsche, our values come from our physiological demands, and what does our physiology demand? Power. It wants to survive and thrive. What does it mean to thrive? To imagine the world a certain way and to be able to make that illusion a reality. Someone could try to contest this idea, by saying that they don ’ t seek power or want to thrive, they won ’ t eat or drink anything to prove this point. But, they would “ still ” be seeking a kind of power, they imagine a world in which they prove the idea wrong and they seek to bring “ that ” world into fruition, even at their own expense.",

It is crucial for individuals to educate themselves during their 20s about their body and options.######In conclusion, the speaker emphasizes that the 20s should not be trivialized but should be recognized as the defining decade of adulthood. Just as the first five years of a child's life shape their development, the 20s have a critical impact on an individual's future. It is essential to understand and embrace the opportunities for growth and development during this period.",

    "question": "Radiation is a word that makes people very nervous. But, to radiate just means, “ giving off ”. Like when the radiator in your house gives off heat in the form of infrared radiation. Different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum correspond to different types of radiation. And, many of them are perfectly harmless. Some of them can be dangerous though. Radiation with very short wavelengths like UV Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays are strong enough to rip electrons out of their atoms, which can cause burns and genetic damage. This is what many people have in mind when they hear the term “ radiation ”. The rest of the spectrum covers a large range of longer waves from Visible Light, Infrared, Microwaves to Radio Waves. This is the kind of radiation that ’ s emitted by all sorts of human technology: mobile phones, Wi-Fi routers, electric power lines, and household appliances. This radiation doesn ’ t disrupt molecules in our body. However, some kinds of radiation can stimulate muscles and nerves and can also make the hair on your body vibrate, which can sometimes cause a tingly feeling above certain threshold values. Other kinds are useful for making dinner. Microwaves push the water molecules in your food around which warms it up. This happens to us all the time. For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach is your skin heating up from exposure to electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.

The second, we want only for the value they bring, though they may be onerous, like exercise or medicine. The third class comprises things we desire for their own sake and the value they offer, like knowledge and health. Glaucon argues that justice belongs to the second class of good: it ’ s a burden that nevertheless brings rewards.

Socrates, as written by Plato, disagrees, countering that justice belongs to the third class of good, offering both extrinsic and intrinsic benefits. Socrates argues that the human soul has three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. Reason guides an individual to truth and knowledge, and is influenced by either spirit or appetite. Spirit is righteous, ambitious, and the source of bold action, while appetite consists of baser, bodily desires.

    "question": "One of the most important principles of Einstein ’ s general relativity is the equivalence principle. It says that: all objects, regardless of their mass and composition, would accelerate in the same manner in the same gravitational field when no external forces act upon them. Confused? Let me put it in simple words. Suppose you simultaneously drop a feather and a stone towards the ground from the same height in a perfectly resistance-less environment. Which one, according to you, will touch the ground first? One may think that as a stone is more massive than a fragile feather, it should experience more gravitational force, and hit the ground first. But that ’ s not the case because as per the principle of equivalence, both objects should fall simultaneously on the ground. In other words, one can say that the inertial and gravitational mass of a body is proportional to each other, which makes the acceleration independent of the physical nature of the body. Now, what is the difference between inertial mass and gravitational mass? The mass that appears in Newton ’ s Second Law of Motion is termed inertial mass. It simply describes how difficult it is to accelerate an object. On the other hand, the mass that appears in Newton ’ s Universal Law of Gravitation is the gravitational mass. It depicts the strength with which gravity acts on a body. So although a stone has more gravitational mass than a feather, the force of gravity acting on it is greater. At the same time, its inertial mass is also greater, which makes it difficult to accelerate. So the two effects cancel out, and it falls with the same acceleration as that of the feather which is precisely the value of acceleration due to gravity in free fall. No matter how small, if there ’ s any violation in the proportionality between inertial and gravitational mass, Einstein ’ s entire system breaks down.",

    "question": "In 1997, a French woman named Jeanne Calment passed away after 122 years and 164 days on this Earth, making her the oldest known person in history. Her age was so astounding that a millionaire pledged $1 million to anyone who could break her record. But in reality, living to this age or beyond is a feat that very few, maybe even no humans, are likely to accomplish. Human bodies just aren ’ t built for extreme aging. Our capacity is set at about 90 years. But what does aging really mean and how does it counteract the body ’ s efforts to stay alive? We know intuitively what it means to age. For some, it means growing up, while for others, it ’ s growing old. Yet finding a strict scientific definition of aging is a challenge. What we can say is that aging occurs when intrinsic processes and interactions with the environment, like sunlight, and toxins in the air, water, and our diets, cause changes in the structure and function of the body ’ s molecules and cells. Those changes in turn drive their decline, and subsequently, the failure of the whole organism. The exact mechanisms of aging are poorly understood.

So one way to think about it is the circadian clock, the clock that tells you what time of day it is and when to arise and when to go to sleep. That doesn ’ t have a minute hand, much less a second hand. In contrast the clock that tells you — the timing device in your brain that tells you, “ Hmm, this red light is taking a bit too long to turn. ” “ This traffic light is taking a bit long to turn ” or “ I think the waiter forgot my coffee. ” That clock doesn ’ t have an hour hand much less number of days that have gone by.

We don ’ t understand, fully understand, how the brain tells you what the tempo of a song is or when the red light is going to change.

Simple, site-specific designs can make a hospital that heals. Designing it is one thing; getting it built, we learned, is quite another. We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called “ Ubudehe, ” which means “ community works for the community. ” Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. Bruce was using the process of building to heal, not just for those who were sick, but for the entire community as a whole. We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or “ lo-fab ”, and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve.

    "question": "In 2015 I traveled to Columbia to prepare for the first ever prevention study in Alzheimer ’ s disease. A simple blood test could detect the mutation. If the study is successful patients could be identified and treated before the onset of symptoms. But what about the rest of the world with Alzheimer ’ s disease do the different genetic and environmental risks, what about patients like my friend David? Today ’ s technologies, smart phones wearables, online patient communities and online assessment tools can be used to gather data in an unprecedented global scale. With enough data, we can begin to understand the emerging genetics and this disease much the way Dr. Lopera did in Columbia. When that happens, we can begin to understand your risk for Alzheimer ’ s disease. The biological pathways that are the most important in you and most importantly, when to begin treatment.

    "question": "The summer learning loss is a term that they use to describe the regressions that kids in low-income neighborhoods face relative to their affluent peers. So they say in lower income neighborhoods kids forget anywhere from two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learned during the school year over the summer, while their middle-class peers break even or even make gains. When I first learned about the achievement gap I was a freshman in college and I certainly wanted to understand what the causes of it were. And as I started to do my research I realized that there were a thousand different reasons why the achievement gap existed: everything from a lack of positive role models to poor health conditions in so many of these inner-city and low-income neighborhoods. And then I found this startling statistic that said that two-thirds of the achievement gap could be directly attributed to unequal summer learning opportunities, or the summer learning loss. In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget anywhere from two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learn over the summer from the school year, and so when they return to school they ’ re now two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months behind their affluent or their middle class peers. Just to put that in perspective for you all: the school year from September to June is only ten months long. If a kid forgets two-and - a-half to three-and - a-half months of what they learned, that ’ s almost 25 to 35 percent of their learning. Teachers have then reported that they spend anywhere from a month-and - a-half to two months reteaching old material. So if you add that additional 20 percent you ’ re talking about 50 percent of a kid ’ s learning. So we sit here and we ask ourselves, “ Why does an eighth grader only have a fourth grade reading level? ” and the truth of the matter is that theoretically speaking they ’ ve only been in school for half the time.",

Typically, it ’ s a silent act, where the person ’ s mouth sinks below the surface of the water and then reappears as they try to breathe. See, once they can no longer hold their initial breath and start to hyperventilate they might aspirate water, triggering something called a laryngospasm. This is where the person ’ s vocal cords spasm, blocking their airways and protecting their lungs. However, it also inconveniently makes yelling for help significantly harder to do. Since the person can ’ t take in any fresh air, their oxygen supply starts to fall, potentially leading to a condition called hypoxia, this is where there ’ s not enough oxygen reaching the body ’ s tissues. And eventually, as the person becomes unconscious, there ’ s a relaxation of their airway, allowing their lungs to fill with water. Depending on how long the person has gone without air, varying levels of damage can occur. For example, a 2013 study found that the likelihood of surviving with little to no brain damage was very low after being submerged for 10 minutes or more. The lack of oxygen can also lead to cardiac arrest. So, basically what I ’ m saying is that drowning is absolutely terrifying. So please wear your life jackets, kids.

There are indeed a bunch of studies to back this up. The consensus is that our eyes are roughly 26 percent worse at reading when it comes to dark mode. The biggest scientific factors for this, are focus, light scatter, and contrast. Let ’ s use a camera lens to explain the first one. Focusing is largely affected by how much light is coming into our eyes and how we focus that light. If a lot of light is coming in like when using light modes, eye pupils contract allowing less light in, creating a wide depth of field, meaning everything is in focus. If this is inverted, less light coming in, that causes our pupils to dilate and that creates a shallower plain of focus, meaning our eyes have to put more efforts into focusing on individual objects. When it comes to reading, you want everything to be in focus. You need that light background for the pupil to work appropriately to minimize amount of light coming in.

The idea is very simple. Any task or project becomes easier once you start working on it. Okay, so think about this. You may notice that when you have a pretty lazy day, it feels even more difficult to do things. So if you didn ’ t do anything in the morning, you may find that it may be actually difficult to do some basic tasks like clean the dishes, or going outside for a walk with your dog. On the other hand, when you ’ re having a very productive day, it feels like you ’ re on a roll. As you go through these tasks and you accomplish those tasks, take off those items in your to-do list, it seems like getting things done is actually easier than you realized before. And this is a basic example of what momentum does for you. It has a lot to do with your confidence in your own work and energy, as well as your ability to trust yourself to actually get things done. And for a lot of people, working on the same type of tasks all the time, while using the same tools, mindset and resources for several hours, is one of the things that contribute a lot to procrastination, and it also contributes to that feeling of lack of progress. That is really unhelpful when trying to boost your confidence in your work and momentum in general.

This practice reflects the widespread belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about the ethics of animal testing and how it ’ s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life, whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status has been seen as binary, either a being ’ s interests matter for their own sake, or they don ’ t. And historically, many philosophers believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn ’ t. Some contemporary philosophers like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then suggests that beings with these capacities are “ persons ” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “ things ” without moral status.

Proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes – you can imagine them as 3 D puzzle pieces. There are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies. Why is this important? Because proteins are in a way the “ language ” of the micro-world. Cells don ’ t have eyes or ears, so to tell friend from foe, they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy. Recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors, that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece. So your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on their outsides that are able to click together, or recognize other protein puzzle pieces. When a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as “ enemy ”, it knows that it has to attack. Only if your cells can make this distinction between friend or foe is your immune system able to fight an invader. But since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces, this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces. This is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year, the influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its hull constantly change a tiny bit.

    "question": "Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success, because rich capitalists like me have never been richer. So the question is, how do we do it? How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share of the economic pie every year? Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago? Is it that we ’ re working harder than we once did? Are we taller, better looking? Sadly, no. It all comes down to just one thing: economics. Because, here ’ s the dirty secret. There was a time in which the economics profession worked in the public interest for everyone, but in the neoliberal era, today, they work only for big corporations and billionaires, and that is creating a little bit of a problem. We could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich, regulate powerful corporations or raise wages for workers. We have done it before. But neoliberal economists would warn that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake, because raising taxes always kills economic growth, and any form of government regulation is inefficient, and raising wages always kills jobs.",

    "question": "Why do we get used to everyday things? Well as human beings, we have limited brain power. And so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits, so we can free up space to learn new things. It ’ s a process called habituation and it ’ s one of the most basic ways, as humans, we learn. Now, habituation isn ’ t always bad. Remember learning to drive? I sure do. Your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel, looking at every single object out there — the cars, the lights, the pedestrians. It ’ s a nerve-wracking experience. So much so, that I couldn ’ t even talk to anyone else in the car and I couldn ’ t even listen to music. But then something interesting happened. As the weeks went by, driving became easier and easier. You habituated it. It started to become fun and second nature. And then, you could talk to your friends again and listen to music. So there ’ s a good reason why our brains habituate things. If we didn ’ t, we ’ d notice every little detail, all the time. It would be exhausting, and we ’ d have no time to learn about new things. But sometimes, habituation isn ’ t good. If it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us, well, that ’ s bad. And if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems, well, then that ’ s really bad.",

This process, known as habituation, is a fundamental way in which humans learn. The speaker also mentioned that habituation can have positive effects, such as making tasks like driving become easier and more enjoyable over time.######In conclusion, habituation is a necessary process to prevent us from being overwhelmed by the constant influx of information. However, it can also be detrimental if it prevents us from noticing and addressing problems in our surroundings. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between habitualization and maintaining awareness of potential issues.",

    "question": "Instead of real eye damage, you might experience eye discomfort. Like blurry vision, dry eyes, watery eyes, and tired eyes. These symptoms even have a name, it ’ s called computer vision syndrome. I know my eyes feel heavy after a long day of staring, but a doctor isn ’ t going to worry about my long-term health. So don ’ t be scared by that really intense name. Still, my eyes are irritated and it ’ s annoying. We likely experience computer vision syndrome because we blink less when we stare at a screen. According to optometrist Allison Bozung from the University of Iowa. Say blink rate slow is pretty significantly in some studies up to about two-thirds, so about 67% slower or less blinking. And it ’ s not easy to consciously blink more. I ’ m very aware of that. You ’ ll probably look a little bit crazy if you try. So instead, use eye drops to keep your eyeballs moist. Make sure they are for that purpose and not for redness relief. Take breaks too. Most doctors recommend the 20-20-20 rule, 20-20-20 rule. 20-20-20 rule. which says that for every 20 minutes that you ’ re on a computer or staring at a screen take 20 seconds to stare at something 20 feet away.

    "question": "The doctor-patient relationship is a founding principle of healthcare and medicine. The first step is to eliminate keyboards and computer screens and clinical encounters. Some doctors in the West can spend up to twice as many hours on medical paperwork than with their patients. In the years ahead, we should be able to eliminate the data clerk functions of clinician. These are mutually hated as much by patients as by doctors and clinician. AI tools such as speech recognition technology that are now commonplace in homes could be used in clinical settings for capturing data and notes, allowing doctors to concentrate on people. We have a problem with accuracy and efficiency. Trained on a huge resource of medical data, the power of AI learning can read some images more accurately than humans. Whether it ’ s a pattern like a scan or a slide, or a prediction, AI can really rev up the accuracy. And that is important for a better diagnosis, better treatments, better outcomes, lower cost. Powerful machines can interpret scans 150 times faster than radiologists, and can work 24 hours a day. AI can even suggest a diagnosis. Many conditions could be AI-diagnosed.

    "question": "Big plants are steady, but they ’ re not very flexible. – Generally, to power something, you have these huge base load gas plants. – And these are running kind of all the time no matter what, and they ’ re pretty slow, and you can ’ t really adjust how much energy they ’ re creating. – When demand is too low, these big slow plants actually lose money. And when demand is too high, quicker, dirtier plants called peaker plants have to switch on to keep up. And they ’ re pretty wasteful. – So you kind of get dinged on both sides. You get dinged when you don ’ t have enough load and then when you have too much, you also get dinged inefficiently. – So, traditional plants aren ’ t super efficient, but they ’ re consistent and therefore predictable. Renewable energy can be another story. Solar and wind power is cheap and clean and plentiful, but only when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. – So, inconsistency is the big worry, that, you know, it ’ ll be a cloudy day or it ’ ll be a still day and then all of the sudden, your appliances won ’ t work, and that ’ s something that no one really wants. – What makes batteries so promising is that they can solve all of these problems. When paired with big power plants, they can supply energy during peak times without polluting the way that peaker plants do And when paired with renewables, they can jump in when clouds roll over a solar farm. Energy storage really is the missing piece of the puzzle for renewable energy. But when we say storage, we don ’ t just necessarily mean these. On a super broad level, a battery is like a bank for energy. You deposit energy into it when you don ’ t need it, and withdraw it when you do.

You were taught in pharmacist school “ just give her drug, give her drug, give her drug ”. Drugs are just band aids. They don ’ t cure us. If you don ’ t have good nutrition, that foundation that we were building our body on isn ’ t there, and so that leads to all sorts of things, you know, depression, leaky gut, you know, your gum disease. People that are constantly having headaches, when they are not growing properly. Our kids don ’ t grow properly cause of nutrition. So, starts to get foundation. If you have a good, good foundation with nutrition, eat it, what you grow or buy it locally, you gonna be way healthier. So crazy how your diet can affect pretty much everything. It ’ s hard to put into a sentence how cool and interesting I thought this whole experience was. I ’ ve always been a firm believer and what you put in your body matters, and the food you put in your body matters. And we are allowing food industries to spray with pesticides, to transport it super far, change its enzymes and nutritional benefits, so that when we are receiving the food, it ’ s not even giving us the fuel that we need to survive in a healthy way. The body is an incredible piece of equipment, machinery. You put good stuff in, it gets good stuff out. You put bad stuff in, in time, bad stuff will come out. But you can correct it.

    "question": "There ’ s evidence that caffeine ’ s effects on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too, reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson ’ s, Alzheimer ’ s, and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body ’ s ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine ’ s effects are so helpful. It might make you feel better and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job of signaling the brain to power down. That ’ s why you may find you need to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine receptors to block.",

    "question": "Of course, living on the moon won ’ t be easy. The camp envisioned is not so much a village as an inhabited research base. Similar to those in places like Antarctica, but there are far greater obstacles to living on the moon than just cold weather. The biggest is cosmic radiation. Unlike the Earth, the moon has no atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive over 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, even in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3 D printers constructing covered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes from the moon ’ s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported from Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil and air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that ’ s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized from recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied by ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore two meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary to the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported or synthesized on site. And lunar inhabitants would have to exercise for hours a day to maintain bone and muscle mass.
